title: "Data Queries"

Data queries select the data that form part of a bucket, using the bucket parameters.

Multiple data queries can be specified for a single bucket definition.

  <Tab title="Sync Streams">
    With Sync Streams, queries directly select data using parameters from `auth`, `subscription`, or `connection`:

    ```yaml
    streams:
      stream_name:
        query: SELECT * FROM table WHERE condition
    ```
    
    See the [Sync Streams documentation](/usage/sync-streams.md) for full syntax details.

    <Info>
      **Data queries are used to group data into buckets, so each data query must use every bucket parameter.**

## Examples

#### Grouping by list\_id

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Sync Streams">
    ```yaml
    streams:
      owned_list:
        query: SELECT * FROM lists WHERE id = subscription.parameter('list_id') AND id IN (SELECT id FROM lists WHERE owner_id = auth.user_id())
      owned_list_todos:
        query: SELECT * FROM todos WHERE list_id = subscription.parameter('list_id') AND list_id IN (SELECT id FROM lists WHERE owner_id = auth.user_id())
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Sync Rules (legacy)">
    ```yaml
    bucket_definitions:
      owned_lists:
        parameters: |
            SELECT id as list_id FROM lists WHERE
               owner_id = request.user_id()
        data:
          - SELECT * FROM lists WHERE lists.id = bucket.list_id
          - SELECT * FROM todos WHERE todos.list_id = bucket.list_id
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Selecting output columns/fields

When specific columns/fields are selected, only those columns/fields are synced to the client.

This is good practice, to ensure the synced data does not unintentionally change when new columns are added to the schema (in the case of Postgres) or to the data structure (in the case of MongoDB).

Note: An `id` column must always be present, and must have a `text` type. If the primary key is different, use a column alias and/or transformations to output a `text` id column.

```yaml
bucket_definitions:
  global:
    data:
      - SELECT id, name, owner_id FROM lists
```

<Info>
  MongoDB uses `_id` as the name of the ID field in collections. Therefore, PowerSync requires using `SELECT _id as id` in the data queries when [using MongoDB](/installation/database-setup) as the backend source database.
</Info>

#### Renaming columns/fields

Different names (aliases) may be specified for columns/fields:

```yaml
bucket_definitions:
  global:
    data:
      - SELECT id, name, created_timestamp AS created_at FROM lists
```

#### Transforming columns/fields

A limited set of operators and functions are available to transform the output value of columns/fields.

```yaml
bucket_definitions:
  global:
    data:
      # Cast number to text
      - SELECT id, item_number :: text AS item_number FROM todos
      # Alternative syntax for the same cast
      - SELECT id, CAST(item_number as TEXT) AS item_number FROM todos
      # Convert binary data (bytea) to base64
      - SELECT id, base64(thumbnail) AS thumbnail_base64 FROM todos
      # Extract field from JSON or JSONB column
      - SELECT id, metadata_json ->> 'description' AS description FROM todos
      # Convert time to epoch number
      - SELECT id, unixepoch(created_at) AS created_at FROM todos
```
