# Metrics Endpoint

PowerSync exposes instance metrics via a Prometheus-compatible endpoint. This allows you to integrate with Prometheus or other monitoring systems that scrape Prometheus endpoints.

<Info>It's not recommended to scrape the Prometheus endpoint manually, we suggest using Prometheus or other compatible tools. PowerSync does not currently support pushing to OpenTelemetry collectors.</Info>

### Configuration

1. To enable metrics, update your PowerSync YAML file to include the `prometheus_port` and set a port number.

```yaml powersync.yaml
telemetry:
  # Set the port at which the Prometheus metrics will be exposed
  prometheus_port: 9090
```

2. Update you Docker compose fle to forward the `prometheus_port`.

```yaml docker-compose.yaml
ports:
  # Forward port 8080 for the PowerSync service
  - 8080:8080
  # Forward port 9090 for Prometheus metrics
  - 9090:9090
```

Once enabled, restart the service and the metrics endpoint will return Prometheus-formatted metrics, as described in the [What is Collected](/self-hosting/lifecycle-maintenance/telemetry#whatiscollected) section of the [Telemetry](/self-hosting/lifecycle-maintenance/telemetry) docs.

<Note>If you're running multiple containers (e.g. splitting up replication containers and API containers) you need to scrape the metrics separately for each container.</Note>
