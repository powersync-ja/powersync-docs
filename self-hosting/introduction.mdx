<Info>
  The PowerSync Open Edition is currently considered a beta release as it still requires more detailed documentation and guides.

  From a stability perspective the Open Edition is production-ready as it uses the same codebase as our Cloud version.

  Please reach out on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/powersync) if you have any questions not yet covered in these docs.
