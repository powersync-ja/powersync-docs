title: "Generate a Development Token"
description: "In this tutorial we will show you how to generate a development token for the self-hosted [PowerSync Service](https://powersync.mintlify.app/architecture/powersync-service#powersync-service)."
---

# Introduction

Development tokens are useful for:
- getting started quickly without implementing full auth config
- sanity checking your sync rules config (were they applied correctly)
- temporarily impersonating a specific user to debug specific issues

# Use Case

Development tokens can be used either with the
- [test-client](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-service/tree/main/test-client), or
- [the diagnostics app](/resources/troubleshooting#diagnostics-app)

# Generate a Development Token
Development tokens can be generated via either
- [PowerSync Cloud](/installation/authentication-setup/development-tokens/#PowerSync-Cloud-Dashboard), or
- locally with a self-hosted setup (described in this tutorial)

<Steps>
    <Step title={"Generate a SharedSecret"}>
        To generate a SharedSecret, you can use this [Online JWS key generator](https://8gwifi.org/jwsgen.jsp):
        <Note>
            You don't need to edit the default payload in the [Online JWS key generator](https://8gwifi.org/jwsgen.jsp).
            You simply need to obtain the generated `SharedSecret` value.
        </Note>
        - Click `Generate JWS Keys`
        - Copy the `SharedSecret` value
        <Warning>
            Using an online key generator for secrets in a production environment is not recommended.
        </Warning>
    </Step>

    <Step title={"Update powersync.yaml"}>
        Update the `k` value in the jwks keys in your `powersync.yaml` config file with the `SharedSecret` value copied in the previous step:
        ```yaml powersync.yaml {8}
        # Client (application end user) authentication settings
        client_auth:
            # JWKS URIs can be specified here
            jwks_uri: !env PS_JWKS_URL
            jwks:
                keys:
                    - kty: 'oct'
                      k: 'YOUR_GENERATED_SHARED_SECRET'
                      alg: 'HS256'
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step title={"Generate a development token"}>
        1. If you have not done so already, clone the [powersync-service repo](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-service/tree/main)
        2. Install the dependencies
            - In the project root, run the following commands:
                ```bash
                pnpm install
                pnpm build:packages
                ```
            -  In the `test-client` directory, run the following commands:
                ```bash
                pnpm build
                ```
        3. Generate a new token by running the following command in the `test-client` directory with your updated `powersync.yaml` config file:
            ```bash
            node dist/bin.js generate-token --config path/to/powersync.yaml --sub test-user
            ```
            You should see an output similar to the following:
            <Frame>
                <img src="/images/tutorials/self-host/token.png" />
            </Frame>
    </Step>
</Steps>
