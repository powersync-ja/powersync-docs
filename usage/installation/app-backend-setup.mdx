sidebarTitle: "Overview"

1. Authenticating app users
2. [Generating JWTs](/usage/installation/authentication-setup) that allows the PowerSync Client SDK to authenticate users against the server-side [PowerSync Service](/architecture/powersync-service).
3. [Writing client-side changes](/usage/installation/app-backend-setup/writing-client-changes) to the backend database (Postgres or MongoDB)

### Authentication

General authentication for your app users is outside the scope of PowerSync. A service such as [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) or [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) may be used, or any other authentication system.

Once a user is authenticated against your app backend, your app backend needs to generate a JWT which can be used by PowerSync Client SDK to authenticate the user against the [PowerSync Service](/architecture/powersync-service).

See [Authentication Setup](/usage/installation/authentication-setup) for details.

### Backend Implementation Examples

See our [Example Projects](/resources/demo-apps-example-projects#custom-backend-examples) page for examples of custom backend implementations (e.g. Django, Node.js, etc.)

For Postgres developers, using [Supabase](/integration-guides/supabase-+-powersync) is an easy alternative to a custom backend. Several of our example apps demonstrate how to use [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) as the Postgres backend.
