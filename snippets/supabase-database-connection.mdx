    </Frame>

3. Back in the PowerSync Dashboard, paste the connection string into the **URI** field. PowerSync will automatically parse this URI to populate the database connection details.
4. Update the **Username** and **Password** fields to use the `powersync_role` and password you created when configuring your Supabase for PowerSync (see [Source Database Setup](/installation/database-setup#supabase)). 
5. Note: PowerSync includes Supabase's CA certificate by default, so you can use `verify-full` SSL mode without additional configuration.
6. Your connection settings should look similar to this:

7. Verify your setup by clicking **Test Connection** and resolve any errors.
8. Click **Next**.
9. PowerSync will detect the Supabase connection and prompt you to enable Supabase auth. To enable it, copy your JWT Secret from your project's settings ([JWT Keys](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/jwt) section in the Supabase dashboard) and paste it here:
    <img src="/images/installation/overview-supabase-auth.png" width="60%" />
<Note>
PowerSync is compatible with Supabase's new [JWT signing keys](https://supabase.com/blog/jwt-signing-keys). See this [Discord thread](https://discord.com/channels/1138230179878154300/1194710422960472175/1396878076683485205) for details on how to configure auth on your connection if you are using these keys.
</Note>

10. Click **Enable Supabase auth** to finalize your connection settings.

PowerSync will now create an isolated cloud environment for your instance. This typically takes a minute or two.

<Tip>
You can update your instance settings by navigating to the **Manage instances** workspace, opening your instance options and selecting **Edit instance**.
