PowerSync is trusted by thousands of developers for building and deploying secure applications.


### PowerSync is SOC 2 Type 2 Audited

SOC 2 Type 2 audit reports are available to customers on the [Team and Enterprise plans](https://www.powersync.com/pricing) of PowerSync Cloud, as well as customers using the Enterprise Self-Hosted Edition. 


### PowerSync Cloud Security

* Customer data is encrypted at rest, access to that data by support staff is strictly controlled by access control mechanisms and robust write-only logging is present across the entire stack.
* All HTTP connections are encrypted using TLS.
* Additionally, customers on our [Enterprise plan](https://www.powersync.com/pricing) can request their data to be housed in managed, isolated tenants.


### PowerSync Cloud: AWS Private Endpoints

See [Private Endpoints](/installation/database-setup/private-endpoints) for using a private network to your database using AWS PrivateLink.

We use Private Endpoints instead of VPC peering, to ensure that no other resources are exposed between VPCs.
