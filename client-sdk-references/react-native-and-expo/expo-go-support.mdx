Expo Go allows you to quickly spin up a sandbox of your application without having to make a development build.

# @powersync/dev Package

The @powersync/dev package provides a pure JavaScript SQLite implementation using SQL.js, allowing PowerSync to work in Expo Go without native dependencies. It uses our custom fork [powersync-sql-js](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-sql-js).

Note: This package is in alpha.

<Warning>
**Development Use Only**

This package will be much slower than DB adapters that use native dependencies, so we only recommend it for development. In production, switch to RNQS or OP-SQLite (see details below).

</Warning>

## Usage

```bash
npm install @powersync/dev
```

```js SystemProvider.tsx
import { SQLJSOpenFactory } from "@powersync/dev";
import { PowerSyncDatabase } from "@powersync/react-native";

export const powerSync = new PowerSyncDatabase({
  schema: AppSchema,
  database: new SQLJSOpenFactory({
    dbFilename: "example.db",
  }),
});
```

The default version of this adapter uses in-memory persistence, but you can specify your own `persister` option to the open factory.
Link to readme for our Expo/React example.

If you need to keep using Expo Go alongside development and production builds, you can switch between different adapters based on the Expo `executionEnvironment`.

```js SystemProvider.tsx
import { SQLJSOpenFactory } from "@powersync/dev";
import { PowerSyncDatabase } from "@powersync/react-native";
import Constants from "expo-constants";

const isExpoGo = Constants.executionEnvironment === "storeClient";

export const powerSync = new PowerSyncDatabase({
  schema: AppSchema,
  database: isExpoGo
    ? new SQLJSOpenFactory({
        dbFilename: "app.db",
      })
    : {
        dbFilename: "sqlite.db",
      },
});
```

## Going to Production

The @powersync/dev package is specifically designed to streamline the development workflow and will be much slower than DB adapters that use native dependencies.

For production builds we recommend switching to our [react-native-quick-sqlite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@journeyapps/react-native-quick-sqlite) or [OP-SQLite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@powersync/op-sqlite) adapters as they give substantially better performance.
