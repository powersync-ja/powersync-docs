Expo Go allows you to quickly spin up a sandbox of your application without having to make a development build.

# @powersync/dev Package

The @powersync/dev package provides a pure JavaScript SQLite implementation using SQL.js, allowing PowerSync to work in Expo Go without native dependencies. It uses our custom fork [powersync-sql-js](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-sql-js).

Note: This package is in alpha.

<Warning>
**Development Use Only**

This package will be much slower than DB adapters that use native dependencies, so we only recommend it for development. In production, switch to RNQS or OP-SQLite (see details below).
</Warning>

## Usage

todo: how to install and use

## Going to Production

The @powersync/dev package is specifically designed to streamline the development workflow and will be much slower than DB adapters that use native dependencies.

For production builds we recommend switching to our [react-native-quick-sqlite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@journeyapps/react-native-quick-sqlite) or [OP-SQLite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@powersync/op-sqlite) adapters as they give substantially better performance.
