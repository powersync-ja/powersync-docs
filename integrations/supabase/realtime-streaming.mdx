title: "Real-time Streaming"
---

If your app uses Supabase Realtime to listen for database changes (via e.g. [Stream](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/dart/stream) in the Supabase Flutter client library), it's fairly simple to obtain the same behavior using PowerSync.

Postgres changes are constantly streamed to the [PowerSync Service](/architecture/powersync-service) via the logical replication publication.

When the PowerSync Client SDK is online, the behavior is as follows:

1. Data changes are streamed from the PowerSync Service to the SDK client over HTTPS
2. Using the `watch()` API, on-device SQLite database changes can be streamed to your app UI

When the SDK is offline, the streaming stops, but automatically resumes when connectivity is restored.

Example implementations of `watch()` can be found below
