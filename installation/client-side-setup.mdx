## Overview

If you're following the [Implementation Outline](/installation/quickstart-guide#implementation-outline): after configuring your database, connecting your PowerSync instance to it, and defining basic [Sync Rules](/usage/sync-rules), the next step is to include the appropriate _PowerSync Client SDK_ package in your app project. On a high level, this involves the following steps:

1. [Install the Client SDK](#installing-the-client-sdk) (see below)

2. [Define your Client-Side Schema](/installation/client-side-setup/define-your-schema)

    * The PowerSync Client SDKs expose a managed SQLite database that your app can read from and write to. The client-side schema refers to the schema for that SQLite database. 

3. [Instantiate the PowerSync Database](/installation/client-side-setup/instantiate-powersync-database)

    * This instantiates the aforemention managed SQLite database.

4. [Integrate with your Backend](/installation/client-side-setup/integrating-with-your-backend) \[Optional]

    * This allows write operations on the client-side SQLite database to be uploaded to your backend and applied to your backend database.

    * Integrating with your backend is also part of [authentication](/installation/authentication-setup) integration. For initial development and testing, you can use [Development Tokens](/installation/authentication-setup/development-tokens), and then implement proper authentication integration at a later time.


## Installing the Client SDK

PowerSync offers a variety of client SDKs. Please see the steps based on your app language and framework:
