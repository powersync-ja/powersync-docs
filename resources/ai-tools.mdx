# PowerSync for AI Coding Tools

We've created resources to help you work with PowerSync using AI-powered IDE tools like Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Claude Desktop, or Windsurf. These tools can help you implement PowerSync features faster and more efficiently.

## AI-Accessible Documentation

PowerSync's documentation is optimized for AI tools in several ways:

### Markdown Version of Documentation Pages

For any page in our documentation, you can append `.md` to the URL to get the Markdown version, which is more easily readable by AI tools, for example:

```
https://docs.powersync.com/client-sdk-references/javascript-web.md
```

<Tip>
Press **CTRL/CMD+C** to easily copy the markdown content of the current page to share with your AI assistant.
</Tip>

### Full Documentation Text

We provide text versions of our documentation that AI tools can easily ingest:

- **Full Documentation**: [https://docs.powersync.com/llms-full.txt](https://docs.powersync.com/llms-full.txt)
  - Our entire documentation site in a single text file
  - Perfect for giving your AI assistant complete context about PowerSync

- **Page Outline**: [https://docs.powersync.com/llms.txt](https://docs.powersync.com/llms.txt)
  - All documentation pages in a single text file
  - This helps AI assistants index our documentation

## AI Prompts for PowerSync Tasks

> **Coming Soon**

We're developing a collection of prompts for common PowerSync implementation tasks. These prompts will help you scaffold PowerSync functionality in your applications faster when working with AI coding assistants.

Let us know on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/powersync) what prompts you'd like to see!


## Best Practices for AI-Assisted PowerSync Development

When working with AI coding assistants consider these tips for better results:

1. **Provide Context**: Be specific about your PowerSync implementation details:
   - Which PowerSync SDK you're using (Web, React Native, Flutter, etc.)
   - Your app's framework or platform (Next.js, Expo, etc.)
   - Whether you are using an ORM with PowerSync (Drift, Kysely or Drizzle)
   - Authentication method (Supabase Auth, Clerk, Firebase Auth, etc.)
   - Target environments (web, mobile, or both)
   - Example: "I'm building a React Native app with Expo using PowerSync React Native SDK with Supabase Auth and Drizzle ORM"

2. **Share Documentation and Examples**: 
   - Include links to specific PowerSync documentation pages and/or repos relevant to your task
   - Reference a relevant [demo app](/resources/demo-apps-example-projects) as an implementation example
   - Share relevant code snippets from your project or from our docs for context
   - Example: "I'm following the pattern from the [PowerSync React Todo List Demo](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-js/tree/main/demos/react-supabase-todolist), specifically how it handles uploading data to Supabase via the `SupabaseConnector`"

3. **Clarify Your Schema**: 
   - Share your database schema with table definitions, relationships and indexes
   - Specify which tables need to be synced vs. local-only
   - Example: "Here's my Postgres schema with User, Task, and Project tables. Tasks belong to Projects, and both belong to Users. All tables need to be synced."

4. **Share your Sync Rules and Offline Requirements**: 
   - Share your PowerSync sync rules configuration and explain the access patterns you're trying to implement
   - Explain how your app should behave offline
   - Example: "Users should only see tasks assigned to them or tasks in projects they own. Users should be able to create and edit tasks offline."
