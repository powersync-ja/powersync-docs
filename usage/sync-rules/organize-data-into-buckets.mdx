title: "Organize Data Into Buckets"
---

To sync different sets of data to each user, data is organized into buckets.

Each user can sync a number of buckets (up to 1,000), and each bucket defines a set of tables/collections and rows/documents to sync.

This is defined using two queries:

1. Select bucket parameters from a user ID and/or other parameters ([parameter queries](/usage/sync-rules/parameter-queries))

2. Select data in the bucket using the bucket parameters ([data queries](/usage/sync-rules/data-queries))

When designing your buckets, it is recommended, but not required, to group all data in a bucket where the same parameters apply.

An example:

```yaml
bucket_definitions:
  user_lists:
    # Select parameters for the bucket, using the current user_id
    # (request.user_id() comes from the JWT token)
    parameters: SELECT request.user_id() as user_id
    data:
      # Select data rows/documents using the parameters above
      - SELECT * FROM lists WHERE owner_id = bucket.user_id
```

<Info>
  **Note**: Table names within Sync Rules must match the names defined in the [client-side schema](/installation/client-side-setup/define-your-schema).
