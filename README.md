# PowerSync Documentation

Welcome to the PowerSync documentation repository! Our docs are powered by [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/docs).

2. **Install Mintlify CLI:**

3. **Start the local docs server:**

## Editing guidelines

### Navigation & Global Settings

- Navigation and other global settings are defined in `docs.json`. Learn more in [Mintlify's docs](https://mintlify.com/docs/settings/global).
- If you move or rename a page, add a redirect using the `redirects` property to ensure existing links continue to work.

### Checking for Broken Links

Regularly check for broken links by running:
```
npx mintlify broken-links
```

### Whitelisting & Blacklisting Terms (Vale)

To whitelist terms so Mintlify's Vale integration does not flag them as misspelled:
- Add terms (one per line, case-insensitive) to `.github/vale/config/vocabularies/PowerSync/accept.txt`.
- To blacklist terms, create a `reject.txt` file in the same folder.
- For more info, see [Mintlify's docs](https://mintlify.com/docs/settings/ci#vale) and [Vale's docs](https://vale.sh/docs/keys/vocab).
