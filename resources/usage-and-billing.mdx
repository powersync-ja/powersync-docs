## How billing works

When using [PowerSync Cloud](https://www.powersync.com/pricing), your organization may contain multiple projects. Each project can contain multiple instances. For example:

* **Organization**: Acme Corporation
   * **Project**: Travel App
         * **Instance**: Staging
         * **Instance**: Production
   * **Project**: Admin App
         * **Instance**: Staging
         * **Instance**: Production

</Note>

Your organization only has a single subscription with a single plan (Free, Pro, Team or Enterprise).

Usage quotas (e.g. data processing, storage, sync operations) apply to your entire organization, regardless of the number of projects.

Upgrading to a paid plan unlocks all benefits for every project in your organization. For example, no instances in a "Pro" organization will be paused. See our [pricing page](https://www.powersync.com/pricing) for plan details.

### Invoicing

Usage for all projects in your organization is aggregated in a monthly billing cycle. These totals are reflected in your monthly invoice.

On our paid plans, the base fee (plus applicable tax) is charged at the start of every billing cycle.

If your month's usage exceeds your plan's limits, the overage will be charged at the end of the billing cycle.

Your current billing cycle's usage and upcoming invoice total can be tracked in the Dashboard - learn more in [View and manage your subscription](/resources/usage-and-billing#view-and-manage-your-subscription).

Invoices will be automatically charged to your provided payment card. Learn more in [Spending caps](/resources/usage-and-billing#spending-caps).

## View and manage your subscription

Your PowerSync usage and billing can be tracked and managed in the [PowerSync Dashboard](https://dashboard.powersync.com/) at the organization level.

### Subscriptions

In the "**Subscriptions**" tab you can:

1. View your active subscription
2. View your usage for the current billing cycle
3. View the amount of your upcoming invoice
4. Upgrade or cancel your [PowerSync subscription](https://www.powersync.com/pricing)

### Billing settings

In the "**Billing"** tab you can:

1. Update billing details, such as your billing organization name, address and email address which should receive invoices and receipts.
2. Manage your credit card(s) used for payments.
   * Credit card details are never stored on our servers; all billing is securely processed by our payment provider, [Stripe](https://stripe.com/).

### Spending caps

Alerts and spending caps are currently in development, and will be available in a future release.

In the meantime, Pro plan invoices over `$100` and Team plan invoices over `$1,000` will not immediately be charged. In these cases, we will reach out to the organization owner for review. This threshold amount can be customized per organization — [let us know](/resources/contact-us) if you need a higher or lower amount configured.

## Limits

Usage limits for PowerSync Cloud are specified on our [Pricing page](https://www.powersync.com/pricing).

### Inactive instances

Instances on the Free plan that have had no deploys or client connections for over 7 days will be deprovisioned. This helps us optimize our cloud resources and ensure a better experience for all users.

If your instance is deprovisioned, you can easily restart it from the [PowerSync Dashboard](https://dashboard.powersync.com/) or [CLI](/tools/cli) by deploying Sync Rules to it. Note that this will reprocess your Sync Rules from scratch, causing data to re-sync to existing users.

For projects in production we recommend subscribing to a [paid plan](https://www.powersync.com/pricing) to avoid any interruptions. To upgrade to a paid plan, navigate to your organization in the [PowerSync Dashboard](https://dashboard.powersync.com/) and visit the **Plans & Billing** section.
