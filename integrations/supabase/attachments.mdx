## <Icon icon="react"iconType="solid" size={32}/> React Native Example

Our React Native [To-Do List demo app](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-js/tree/main/demos/react-native-supabase-todolist) showcases how to sync attachments (such as photos) using the [@powersync/attachments](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@powersync/attachments) library, the PowerSync Service, and Supabase.

In this example, we are syncing photos, however other media types, such as [PDFs](/client-sdks/advanced/attachments-pdfs), are also supported.

The library and this example implementation can be used as a reference for implementing similar functionality for a Postgres backend without Supabase.

<Note>
   The below assumes you have completed the steps outlined in the [To-Do List app Readme](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-js/tree/main/demos/react-native-supabase-todolist). This includes installing and running the PowerSync React Native SDK; setting up a Supabase project; setting up a PowerSync instance and connecting it with Supabase.
</Note>

### Configure Storage in Supabase

In this demo app, [Supabase Storage](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage) is used to store and serve attachments. 

<SupabaseStorage />

Finally, link this storage bucket to your app by opening up the **AppConfig.ts** file and adding the bucket name as the value to the `supabaseBucket` key:

</Frame>

This concludes the necessary configuration for handling attachments in the To-Do List demo app. When running the app now, a photo can be taken for a to-do list item, and PowerSync will ensure that the photo syncs to Supabase and other devices (if Sync Rules allow).

Read on to learn more about how this works under the hood.

### Implementation Details

The [@powersync/attachments](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@powersync/attachments) library is used in conjunction with the PowerSync Service to sync photos. Refer to the library's [README](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@powersync/attachments) for an overview of the main components. In summary, they are:

* `AttachmentRecord` to store the metadata of attachments.
* `AttachmentState` to track the sync state of an `AttachmentRecord`.
* `AbstractAttachmentQueue` class to manage and sync `AttachmentRecord`s:
   * Track and sync attachment metadata.
   * Watch for changes and handle CRUD operations on `AttachmentRecord`s.
   * Store attachment data on the user's local storage, using file URIs on the device.

The UI of the demo app supports taking photos as follows:

* [CameraWidget](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-js/blob/main/demos/react-native-supabase-todolist/library/widgets/CameraWidget.tsx) uses `expo-camera` to allow users to capture a photo.
* The photo is stored on the user's local storage.
   * See the [savePhoto()](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-js/blob/main/demos/react-native-supabase-todolist/library/powersync/PhotoAttachmentQueue.ts) method.
* The app includes a basic prompt for the user to grant permission to use the device's camera.

The [app's schema](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-js/blob/main/demos/react-native-supabase-todolist/library/powersync/AppSchema.ts) was modified to link a photo to a to-do item:

* A `photo_id` was added as a column to the `todos` table to link a photo to a to-do item.
* A local-only `attachments` table is instantiated to store the metadata of photos.
   * See [new AttachmentTable()](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-js/blob/main/demos/react-native-supabase-todolist/library/powersync/AppSchema.ts)

The [PhotoAttachmentQueue](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-js/blob/main/demos/react-native-supabase-todolist/library/powersync/PhotoAttachmentQueue.ts) class extends the `AbstractAttachmentQueue` abstract class and:

* Uses a PowerSync query to gather the relevant photo IDs (see `attachmentIds()`)
* Creates `AttachmentRecord`s to store photo metadata. (see `newAttachmentRecord()`)
* Uses the `savePhoto()` method to save photos into local storage and add them to the sync queue.

#### How Syncing Works

Refer to [this section](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@powersync/attachments#syncing-attachments) in the library's README to learn more about the various sync states and operations.

### Future Improvements

The following improvements can be considered for this implementation.

* An easier way to set up the local-only `attachments` table and related schema.
* Better tooling/APIs for retrying/resuming uploads or downloads when transitioning from an offline into an online state.

Our Flutter [To-Do List demo app](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync.dart/tree/master/demos/supabase-todolist) showcases how to sync attachments (such as photos) using our new attachments library under `package:powersync_core/attachments/attachments.dart`. Compared to the legacy [powersync_attachments_helper](https://pub.dev/packages/powersync_attachments_helper) library, it comes with additional functionality such as letting you provide your own local storage implementation, supporting dynamic nested directories and per-attachment file extensions out of the box, and aligns its APIs with our other SDKs. See the library's docs here: [powersync_core attachments](https://pub.dev/documentation/powersync_core/latest/topics/attachments-topic.html).
