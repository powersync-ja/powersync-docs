title: "PowerSync Service"
---

When we say "PowerSync instance" we are referring to an instance of the [PowerSync Service](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-service), which is the server-side component of the sync engine responsible for the _read path_ from the source database to client-side SQLite databases: The primary purpose of the PowerSync Service is replicating data from your source database (Postgres, MongoDB, MySQL, SQL Server), and streaming data to clients.


## Replication

When the PowerSync Service replicates data from the source database, it:

1. Pre-processes the data according to the [Sync Rules](/sync/rules/overview), splitting data into _sync buckets_ and transforming the data if required.
2. Persists each operation into the relevant sync buckets, ready to be streamed to clients.

The recent history of operations on each <Tooltip tip="In the case of a NoSQL source database like MongoDB, it would be more accurate to say 'document' rather than 'row'">row</Tooltip> is stored, not only the current version of the row. This supports the "append-only" structure of sync buckets, which allows clients to efficiently stream changes while maintaining data integrity. Sync buckets can be compacted to avoid an ever-growing history.

### Initial Replication vs. Incremental Replication

Whenever a new version of Sync Rules are deployed, initial replication takes place by means of taking a snapshot of all tables/collections defined in the Sync Rules

After that, data is incrementally replicated using a change data capture stream (the specific mechanism depends on the source database type: Postgres logical replication, MongoDB change streams, the MySQL binlog, or SQL Server Change Data Capture).


## Authentication

The PowerSync Service authenticates clients/users using [JWTs](/configuration/auth/overview).


## Streaming Sync

Once a client/user is authenticated:

1. The PowerSync Service calculates a list of buckets for the user to sync using [Parameter Queries](/sync/rules/parameter-queries).
2. The Service streams any operations added to those buckets since the last time the client/user connected.

The Service then continuously monitors for buckets that are added or removed, as well as for new operations within those buckets, and streams those changes.

Only the internal (replicated) storage of the PowerSync Service is used — the source database is not queried directly during streaming.
