description: "Set up unit tests for PowerSync in Dart/Flutter"
---

<Note>
This guide is currently specific to the Dart/Flutter SDK. We may expand it to cover other SDKs in the future.
</Note>

For unit testing your projects using PowerSync (for example, testing whether your queries run as expected), you'll need the `powersync-sqlite-core` binary in your project's root directory.

## Setup

1. Download the PowerSync SQLite binary
   - Go to [powersync-sqlite-core Releases](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-sqlite-core/releases)
   - Download the binary for your OS
2. Rename the binary
   - Remove the architecture suffix from the filename
   - Examples:
     - `powersync_x64.dll` → `powersync.dll` (Windows)
     - `libpowersync_aarch64.dylib` → `libpowersync.dylib` (macOS)
     - `libpowersync_x64.so` → `libpowersync.so` (Linux)
3. Place the binary
   - Move the renamed binary to your project's root directory

## Example Test

This example shows basic unit testing with PowerSync in Flutter. For more information, see the [Flutter unit testing documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/testing/unit/introduction).

```dart
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:powersync/powersync.dart';
import 'package:path/path.dart';

const schema = Schema([
    Table('customers', [Column.text('name'), Column.text('email')])
]);

late PowerSyncDatabase testDB;

String getTestDatabasePath() async {
    const dbFilename = 'powersync-test.db';
    final dir = Directory.current.absolute.path;
    return join(dir, dbFilename);
}

Future<void> openTestDatabase() async {
    testDB = PowerSyncDatabase(
      schema: schema,
      path: await getTestDatabasePath(),
      logger: testLogger,
    );

    await testDB.initialize();
}

test('INSERT', () async {
    await testDB.execute(
          'INSERT INTO customers(name, email) VALUES(?, ?)', ['John Doe', 'john@hotmail.com']);

    final results = await testDB.getAll('SELECT * FROM customers');

    expect(results.length, 1);
    expect(results, ['John Doe', 'john@hotmail.com']);
});
```

#### If you have trouble with loading the extension, confirm the following

Ensure that your SQLite3 binary install on your system has extension loading enabled. You can confirm this by doing the following

- Run `sqlite3` in your command-line interface.
- In the sqlite3 prompt run `PRAGMA compile_options;`
- Check the output for the option `ENABLE_LOAD_EXTENSION`.
- If you see `ENABLE_LOAD_EXTENSION`, it means extension loading is enabled.

If the above steps don't work, you can also confirm if extension loading is enabled by trying to load the extension in your command-line interface.

- Run `sqlite3` in your command-line interface.
- Run `.load /path/to/file/libpowersync.dylib` (macOS) or `.load /path/to/file/libpowersync.so` (Linux) or `.load /path/to/file/powersync.dll` (Windows).
- If this runs without error, then extension loading is enabled. If it fails with an error message about extension loading being disabled, then it’s not enabled in your SQLite installation.

If it is not enabled, you will have to download a compiled SQLite binary with extension loading enabled (e.g. using Homebrew) or [compile SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/howtocompile.html) with extension loading enabled and
include it in your project's folder alongside the extension.
