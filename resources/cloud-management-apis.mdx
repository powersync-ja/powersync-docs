# PowerSync Cloud Instance Management APIs

The PowerSync Cloud Management APIs allow you to manage your PowerSync Cloud instances using HTTP requests. These APIs are subject to change and we'll update this page as we make changes.


## Authentication
The PowerSync Cloud Management APIs are authenticated using a personal access token (PAT). You can generate a JWT token using the PowerSync Cloud dashboard.

Once you have a JWT token, you can use it to authenticate your requests to the PowerSync Cloud Management APIs by adding the `Authorization` header to your requests e.g. 

``` http request
{
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer <PAT>"
}
```


## API Reference

When using the PowerSync Cloud Instance Management APIs you must provide the following values in the body of your request:
- `id`: The ID of your PowerSync Cloud instance - This can be found in the instance url e.g. https://<id>.powersync.journeyapps.com.
- `org_id`: The ID of your organization - This can be found in the PowerSync Project url e.g. https://powersync.journeyapps.com/orgs/<org_id>.
- `app_id`: The ID of your PowerSync Project - This can be found in the PowerSync Project url e.g. https://powersync.journeyapps.com/orgs/<org_id>/app/<app_id>.

You can get the ID of your PowerSync Cloud instance by clicking on the "Copy instance URL" icon in the PowerSync Cloud dashboard.

### Create PowerSync Cloud instance

Create a new PowerSync Cloud instance.

```
curl --request POST \
  --url https://powersync-api.journeyapps.com/api/v1/instances/create \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <PAT>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"name":"Your Instance Name","org_id":"your_organization_id","app_id":"your_powersync_project_id"}'
```

This will provision a new PowerSync Cloud instance.

### PowerSync Instance Status

Get the status history of your PowerSync Cloud instance.

```
curl --request POST \
  --url https://powersync-api.journeyapps.com/api/v1/instances/status \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <PAT>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"id":"your_powersync_instance_id","org_id":"your_organization_id","app_id":"your_powersync_project_id"}'
```

This will return the status of your PowerSync Cloud instance.

### Deprovision a PowerSync Cloud instance

Deprovision a PowerSync Cloud instance. 

```
curl --request POST \
  --url https://powersync-api.journeyapps.com/api/v1/instances/deprovision \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <PAT>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"id":"your_powersync_instance_id","org_id":"your_organization_id","app_id":"your_powersync_project_id"}'
```

<Warning>This will stop the instance and remove the bucket storage associated with the instance. When an instance is deprovisioned, and you want to re-provision it, you will need to redeploy your sync rules, by making a whitespace change in the sync-rules.yaml file.</Warning>
