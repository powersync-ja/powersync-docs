import GenerateSchemaAutomatically from '/snippets/generate-schema-automatically.mdx';

The PowerSync Client SDKs expose a managed SQLite database that your app can read from and write to. The client-side schema refers to the schema for that SQLite database.

The client-side schema is typically mainly derived from your backend database schema and [Sync Rules](/usage/sync-rules), but can also include other tables such as local-only tables. 

Note that schema migrations are not required on the SQLite database due to the schemaless nature of the [PowerSync protocol](/architecture/powersync-protocol): schemaless data is synced to the client-side SQLite database, and the client-side schema is then applied to that data using _SQLite views_ to allow for structured querying of the data.

## Example implementation

For an example implementation of the client-side schema, see the _Getting Started_ section of the SDK reference for your platform:

## Next Step

The next step is to instantiate the client-side PowerSync database:
