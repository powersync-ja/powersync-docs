The PowerSync [JavaScript Web SDK](../javascript-web) is compatible with popular Single-Page Application (SPA) frameworks like React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, and Nuxt. 

For [React](#react-hooks) and [Vue](#vue-composables) specifically, wrapper packages are available to support reactivity and live queries, making it easier for developers to leverage PowerSync's features.

PowerSync also integrates with TanStack libraries, including [TanStack Query](#tanstack-query) for React and [TanStack DB](#tanstack-db) for reactive data management across multiple frameworks.

### Which package should I choose for queries?

For React or React Native apps:

* The [`@powersync/react`](#react-hooks) package is best for most basic use cases, especially when you only need reactive queries with loading and error states.

* For more advanced scenarios, such as query caching and pagination, [TanStack Query](#tanstack-query) is a powerful solution. The [`@powersync/tanstack-react-query`](#tanstack-query) package extends the `useQuery` hook from `@powersync/react` and adds functionality from [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview), making it a better fit for advanced use cases or performance-optimized apps.

* If you have a Vue app or a Nuxt app, you can use [`@powersync/vue`](#vue-composables) or [`@powersync/nuxt`](#nuxt) respectively.

* For reactive data management and live query support across multiple frameworks, consider [TanStack DB](#tanstack-db). PowerSync works with all TanStack DB framework adapters (React, Vue, Solid, Svelte, Angular).

## React Hooks

<Card title="npm: @powersync/react" icon="npm" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@powersync/react" horizontal />

The `@powersync/react` package provides React hooks for use with the [JavaScript Web SDK](./) or [React Native SDK](../react-native-and-expo/). These hooks are designed to support reactivity, and can be used to automatically re-render React components when query results update or to access PowerSync connectivity status changes.

The main hooks available are:

* `useQuery`: This allows you to access the results of a watched query. The response includes `isLoading`, `isFetching` and `error` properties.

* `useStatus`: Access the PowerSync connectivity status. This can be used to update the UI based on whether the client is connected or not.

* `useSuspenseQuery`: This hook also allows you to access the results of a watched query, but its loading and fetching states are handled through [Suspense](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense). It automatically converts certain loading/fetching states into Suspense signals, triggering Suspense boundaries in parent components.

## TanStack

PowerSync integrates with multiple TanStack libraries:

### TanStack Query

PowerSync integrates with [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview) (formerly React Query) through the `@powersync/tanstack-react-query` package.

<Card title="npm: @powersync/tanstack-react-query" icon="npm" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@powersync/tanstack-react-query" horizontal />

This package wraps TanStack's `useQuery` and `useSuspenseQuery` hooks, bringing many of TanStack's advanced asynchronous state management features to PowerSync web and React Native applications, including:

* **Loading and error states** via [`useQuery`](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/queries)

* [**React Suspense**](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/suspense) **support**: `useSuspenseQuery` automatically converts certain loading states into Suspense signals, triggering Suspense boundaries in parent components.

* [**Caching queries**](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/caching): Queries are cached with a unique key and reused across the app, so subsequent instances of the same query won't refire unnecessarily.

* **Built-in support for** [**pagination**](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/paginated-queries)

<Info>
  #### Additional hooks

  We plan to support more TanStack Query hooks over time. If there are specific hooks you're interested in, please let us know on [Discord](https://discord.gg/powersync).
</Info>

#### Example Use Case

When navigating to or refreshing a page, you may notice a brief UI "flicker" (10-50ms). Here are a few ways to manage this with TanStack Query:

* **First load**: When a page loads for the first time, use a loading indicator or a Suspense fallback to handle queries. See the [examples](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@powersync/tanstack-react-query#usage).

* **Subsequent loads**: With TanStack's query caching, subsequent loads of the same page won't refire queries, which reduces the flicker effect.

* **Block navigation until components are ready**: Using `useSuspenseQuery`, you can ensure that navigation from page A to page B only happens after the queries for page B have loaded. You can do this by combining `useSuspenseQuery` with the `<Suspense />` element and React Router’s [`v7_startTransition`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/upgrading/future#v7_starttransition) future flag, which blocks navigation until all suspending components are ready.

#### Usage and Examples

For more examples and usage details, see the package [README](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@powersync/tanstack-react-query).

### TanStack DB

[TanStack DB](https://tanstack.com/db/latest/docs/collections/powersync-collection) is a reactive client store that provides blazing-fast in-memory queries, optimistic updates, and cross-collection queries. When combined with PowerSync, you get the best of both worlds: TanStack DB's powerful query capabilities with PowerSync's battle-tested offline-first and multi-tab capable sync engine.

**TanStack DB Features:**

* **Blazing Fast In-Memory Queries**: Built on differential data flow, TanStack DB's live queries update incrementally (rather than re-running entire queries), making queries incredibly fast, even for complex queries across multiple collections.

* **Reactive Data Flow**: Live queries automatically update when underlying data changes, triggering component re-renders only when necessary.

* **Optimistic Updates**: Mutations apply instantly to the local state, providing immediate user feedback. TanStack DB maintains separate optimistic state that overlays on top of synced data, and automatically rolls back if the server request fails.

* **Cross-Collection Queries**: Live queries support joins across collections, allowing you to load normalized data and then denormalize it through queries. 

**Framework Support:**

PowerSync works with all TanStack DB framework adapters:

* React ([`@tanstack/react-db`](https://tanstack.com/db/latest/docs/framework/react/overview))
* Vue ([`@tanstack/vue-db`](https://tanstack.com/db/latest/docs/framework/vue/overview))
* Solid ([`@tanstack/solid-db`](https://tanstack.com/db/latest/docs/framework/solid/overview))
* Svelte ([`@tanstack/svelte-db`](https://tanstack.com/db/latest/docs/framework/svelte/overview))
* Angular ([`@tanstack/angular-db`](https://tanstack.com/db/latest/docs/framework/angular/overview))

## Vue Composables

<Card title="npm: @powersync/vue" icon="npm" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@powersync/vue" horizontal />

The [`powersync/vue`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@powersync/vue) package is a Vue-specific wrapper for PowerSync. It provides Vue [composables](https://vuejs.org/guide/reusability/composables) that are designed to support reactivity, and can be used to automatically re-render components when query results update or to access PowerSync connectivity status changes.

The main hooks available are:

* `useQuery`: This allows you to access the results of a watched query. The response includes `isLoading`, `isFetching` and `error` properties.

* `useStatus`: Access the PowerSync connectivity status. This can be used to update the UI based on whether the client is connected or not.

## Nuxt

<Card title="npm: @powersync/nuxt" icon="npm" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@powersync/nuxt" horizontal />

The `@powersync/nuxt` package is a Nuxt module that provides PowerSync integration for Nuxt applications. It automatically exposes all [`@powersync/vue`](#vue-composables) composables.

Key features include:

* **All Vue composables available**: Access to `useQuery`, `useStatus`, `usePowerSyncWatchedQuery`, and all other composables from `@powersync/vue`.

* **Built-in diagnostics**: Direct access to your PowerSync client and local SQLite diagnostics through the PowerSync Inspector.

* **Kysely ORM support**: Use the `usePowerSyncKysely()` composable for type-safe database queries with Kysely.
