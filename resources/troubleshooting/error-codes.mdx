This reference documents PowerSync error codes organized by component, with troubleshooting suggestions for developers. Use the search bar to look up specific error codes (e.g., `PSYNC_R0001`).

# PSYNC_Rxxxx: Sync rules issues

- **PSYNC_R0001**:
  Catch-all sync rules parsing error, if no more specific error is available

# PSYNC_Sxxxx: Service issues

- **PSYNC_S0001**:
  Internal assertion.
  
  If you see this error, it might indicate a bug in the service code.

- **PSYNC_S0102**:
  TEARDOWN was not acknowledged.
  
  This happens when the TEARDOWN argument was not supplied when running
  the service teardown command. The TEARDOWN argument is required since
  this is a destructive command.
  
  Run the command with `teardown TEARDOWN` to confirm.

## PSYNC_S1xxx: Replication issues

- **PSYNC_S1002**:
  Row too large.
  
  There is a 15MB size limit on every replicated row - rows larger than
  this cannot be replicated.

- **PSYNC_S1003**:
  Sync rules have been locked by another process for replication.
  
  This error is normal in some circumstances:
  1. In some cases, if a process was forcefully terminated, this error may occur for up to a minute.
  2. During rolling deploys, this error may occur until the old process stops replication.
  
  If the error persists for longer, this may indicate that multiple replication processes are running.
  Make sure there is only one replication process apart from rolling deploys.

- **PSYNC_S1004**:
  JSON nested object depth exceeds the limit of 20.
  
  This may occur if there is very deep nesting in JSON or embedded documents.

## PSYNC_S11xx: Postgres replication issues

- **PSYNC_S1101**:
  Replication assertion error.
  
  If you see this error, it might indicate a bug in the service code.

- **PSYNC_S1103**:
  Aborted initial replication.
  
  This is not an actual error - it is expected when the replication process
  is stopped, or if replication is stopped for any other reason.

- **PSYNC_S1104**:
  Explicit cacert is required for `sslmode: verify-ca`.
  
  Use either verify-full, or specify a certificate with verify-ca.
