1. Copy the database connection details from Supabase:

   </Frame>

   * Copy the connection string. The hostname should be `db.<PROJECT-ID>.supabase.co`, and not, for example, `aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com`.

   * Paste this URI in PowerSync instance **URI** field.

   * Enter the **Password** for the `postgres` user in your Supabase database.

     * Supabase also [refers to this password](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/managing-passwords) as the *database password* or *project password*.

   * PowerSync has the Supabase CA certificate pre-configured â€” `verify-full` SSL mode can be used directly, without any custom certificates.

   * In your Supabase dashboard, navigate to **Project Settings** > **Database** > **Connection string** and select the "URI" tab.

   * Uncheck the **Display connection pooler** checkbox. PowerSync needs to connect to the database directly and cannot use the pooler.

2. Click **Test Connection** and fix any errors.

3. Under the **Client Auth** tab, enable **Use Supabase Auth** and enter your Supabase **JWT Secret**:

4. Click **Save and deploy** to deploy the updates to your instance.

PowerSync deploys and configures an isolated cloud environment for you, which will take a few minutes to complete.
