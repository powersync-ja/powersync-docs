## Instance Settings

After creating an instance, you can configure various settings through the [PowerSync Dashboard](https://dashboard.powersync.com/):

- **Database Connections**: Connect your instance to your source database. See [Source Database Connection](/configuration/source-db/connection) for details.
- **Client Auth**: Configure how clients authenticate. See [Authentication Setup](/configuration/auth/overview) for details.
- **Sync Streams / Sync Rules (legacy)**: Define what data to sync to clients. See [Sync Streams & Sync Rules Overview](/sync/overview) for details.
- **Settings**: Advanced instance-specific settings.

For more information about managing instances, see the [PowerSync Dashboard](/tools/powersync-dashboard) documentation.
