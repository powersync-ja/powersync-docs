Data doesn't always flow in the direction of your firewall rules, so the below table documents which components are making connections to others:

| Request Originator | Request Destination        | Protocol    |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | ----------- |
| PowerSync Service  | Postgres                   | TCP         |
| PowerSync Service  | MongoDB                    | TCP         |
| PowerSync Service  | OpenTelemetry Collector    | TCP or UDP  |
| PowerSync Service  | JWKS Endpoint              | TCP (HTTPS) |
| App Client         | PowerSync Service (via LB) | TCP (HTTPS) |
| App Client         | App Backend                | TCP (HTTPS) |
| App Backend        | Postgres                   | TCP         |
