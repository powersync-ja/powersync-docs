description: "Guidance on using PowerSync with popular Flutter state management libraries."
---

Our [demo apps](/resources/demo-apps-example-projects) for Flutter are intentionally kept simple to put a focus on demonstrating
PowerSync APIs.
Instead of using heavy state management solutions, they use simple global fields to make the PowerSync database accessible to widgets.
When adopting PowerSync, you might be interested in using a more sophisticated approach for state management.
This section explains how PowerSync's Flutter SDK integrates with popular packages for state management.

<Note>
Adopting PowerSync can simplify the architecture of your app by using SQLite as the single source of truth for all data.
For a general discussion on how PowerSync fits into modern app architecture on Flutter, also see [this blogpost](https://dinkomarinac.dev/building-local-first-flutter-apps-with-riverpod-drift-and-powersync).
</Note>

PowerSync exposes database queries with the standard `Future` and `Stream` classes from `dart:async`. Given how widely used these are
in the Dart ecosystem, PowerSync works well with all popular approaches for state management, such as:

1. Providers with `package:provider`: Create your database as a `Provider` and expose watched queries to child widgets with `StreamProvider`!
   The provider for databases should `close()` the database in `dispose`.
2. Providers with `package:riverpod`: We mention relevant snippets [below](#riverpod).
3. Dependency injection with `package:get_it`: PowerSync databases can be registered with `registerSingletonAsync`. Again, make sure
   to `close()` the database in the `dispose` callback.
4. The BLoC pattern with the `bloc` package: You can easily listen to watched queries in Cubits (although, if you find your
   Blocs and Cubits becoming trivial wrappers around database streams, consider just `watch()`ing database queries in widgets directly.
   That doesn't make your app [less testable](/client-sdk-references/flutter/unit-testing)!).
   To simplify state management, avoid the use of hydrated blocs and cubits for state that depends on database queries. With PowerSync,
   regular data is already available locally and doesn't need a second local cache.

## Riverpod

<Tip>
We have a [complete example](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync.dart/tree/main/demos/supabase-todolist-drift) on using PowerSync
with modern Flutter libraries like Riverpod, Drift and `auto_route`.
</Tip>

A good way to open PowerSync databases with Riverpod is to use an async provider. You can also manage your `connect` and
`disconnect` calls there, for instance by listening to the authentication state:

```dart
@Riverpod(keepAlive: true)
Future<PowerSyncDatabase> powerSyncInstance(Ref ref) async {
  final db = PowerSyncDatabase(
    schema: schema,
    path: await _getDatabasePath(),
    logger: attachedLogger,
  );
  await db.initialize();

  // TODO: Listen for auth changes and connect() the database here.
  ref.listen(yourAuthProvider, (prev, next) {
    if (next.isAuthenticated && !prev.isAuthenticated) {
      db.connect(connector: MyConnector());
    }

    // ...
  });

  ref.onDispose(db.close);
  return db;
}
```

### Running queries

To expose auto-updating query results, use a `StreamProvider` reading the database:

```dart
final _lists = StreamProvider((ref) async* {
  final database = await ref.read(powerSyncInstanceProvider.future);
  yield* database.watch('SELECT * FROM lists');
});
```

### Waiting for sync

If you were awaiting `waitForFirstSync` before, you can keep doing that:

```dart
final db = await ref.read(powerSyncInstanceProvider.future);
await db.waitForFirstSync();
```

Alternatively, you can expose the sync status as a provider and use that to determine
whether the synchronization has completed:

```dart
final syncStatus = statefulProvider<SyncStatus>((ref, change) {
  final status = Stream.fromFuture(ref.read(powerSyncInstanceProvider.future))
      .asyncExpand((db) => db.statusStream);
  final sub = status.listen(change);
  ref.onDispose(sub.cancel);

  return const SyncStatus();
});

@riverpod
bool didCompleteSync(Ref ref, [BucketPriority? priority]) {
  final status = ref.watch(syncStatus);
  if (priority != null) {
    return status.statusForPriority(priority).hasSynced ?? false;
  } else {
    return status.hasSynced ?? false;
  }
}

final class MyWidget extends ConsumerWidget {
  const MyWidget({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    final didSync = ref.watch(didCompleteSyncProvider());

    if (!didSync) {
      return const Text('Busy with sync...');
    }

    // ... content after first sync
  }
}
```

### Attachment queue

If you're using the attachment queue helper to synchronize media assets, you can also wrap that in a provider:

```dart
@Riverpod(keepAlive: true)
Future<YourAttachmentQueue> attachmentQueue(Ref ref) async {
  final db = await ref.read(powerSyncInstanceProvider.future);
  final queue = YourAttachmentQueue(db, remoteStorage);
  await queue.init();
  return queue;
}
```

Reading and awaiting this provider can then be used to show attachments:

```dart
final class PhotoWidget extends ConsumerWidget {
  final TodoItem todo;

  const PhotoWidget({super.key, required this.todo});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    final photoState = ref.watch(_getPhotoStateProvider(todo.photoId));
    if (!photoState.hasValue) {
      return Container();
    }

    final data = photoState.value;
    if (data == null) {
      return Container();
    }

    String? filePath = data.photoPath;
    bool fileIsDownloading = !data.fileExists;
    bool fileArchived =
        data.attachment?.state == AttachmentState.archived.index;

    if (fileArchived) {
      return Column(
        crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: [
          const Text("Unavailable"),
          const SizedBox(height: 8),
        ],
      );
    }

    if (fileIsDownloading) {
      return const Text("Downloading...");
    }

    File imageFile = File(filePath!);
    int lastModified = imageFile.existsSync()
        ? imageFile.lastModifiedSync().millisecondsSinceEpoch
        : 0;
    Key key = ObjectKey('$filePath:$lastModified');

    return Image.file(
      key: key,
      imageFile,
      width: 50,
      height: 50,
    );
  }
}

class _ResolvedPhotoState {
  String? photoPath;
  bool fileExists;
  Attachment? attachment;

  _ResolvedPhotoState(
      {required this.photoPath, required this.fileExists, this.attachment});
}

@riverpod
Future<_ResolvedPhotoState> _getPhotoState(Ref ref, String? photoId) async {
  if (photoId == null) {
    return _ResolvedPhotoState(photoPath: null, fileExists: false);
  }
  final queue = await ref.read(attachmentQueueProvider.future);
  final photoPath = await queue.getLocalUri('$photoId.jpg');

  bool fileExists = await File(photoPath).exists();

  final row = await queue.db
      .getOptional('SELECT * FROM attachments_queue WHERE id = ?', [photoId]);

  if (row != null) {
    Attachment attachment = Attachment.fromRow(row);
    return _ResolvedPhotoState(
        photoPath: photoPath, fileExists: fileExists, attachment: attachment);
  }

  return _ResolvedPhotoState(
      photoPath: photoPath, fileExists: fileExists, attachment: null);
}
```
