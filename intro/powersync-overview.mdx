title: PowerSync Overview
description: 'Sync Engine for Local-First & Offline-First Apps'
---

[PowerSync](https://www.powersync.com/) is a service and set of client SDKs that keeps backend databases in sync with on-device embedded SQLite databases.

It enables real-time reactive [local-first](/resources/local-first-software) & offline-first apps that remain available even when network connectivity is poor or non-existent.
