Below, you can find provider-specific instructions to obtain connection details that you need to specify in your configuration file (see [PowerSync Service Setup](/self-hosting/installation/powersync-service-setup)).

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Supabase">
    1. In your Supabase dashboard, navigate to **"Project Settings"** \-> **"Database" -> "Connection string**" and select the "URI" tab.
    2. Uncheck the "**Display connection pooler**" checkbox. PowerSync needs to connect to the database directly and cannot use the pooler.

    </Frame>
    3. Copy the connection string. The hostname should be `db.<PROJECT-ID>.supabase.co`, and not, for example, `aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com`.
    4. Paste this URI into the `uri` field under `replication` \> `connections` in your configuration file, for example:

    ```yaml
    # config.yaml

    replication:
      connections:
        - type: postgresql
          uri: postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@db.abc.supabase.co:5432/postgres
    ```

    5. Replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` with the password for the `postgres` user in your Supabase database.
      * Supabase also [refers to this password](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/managing-passwords) as the _database password_ or _project password_.
    6. PowerSync has the Supabase CA certificate pre-configured — `verify-full` SSL mode can be used directly, without any custom certificates.
    7. Under `client_auth` enable Supabase Authentication:

    ```yaml
    client_auth:
      supabase: true
      supabase_jwt_secret: [secret]
    ```
    For more details, see [Supabase Auth](/installation/authentication-setup/supabase-auth).
