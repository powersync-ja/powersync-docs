title: "Global Buckets"
description: 'The simplest Sync Rules are for "global" data — synced to all users, using "global buckets"'
---

Any bucket with no _Parameter Query_ in the bucket definition is automatically a _global bucket_. These buckets will be synced to all clients/users. 

For example, the following Sync Rules sync all `todos` and only unarchived `lists` to all users:

```yaml
bucket_definitions:
  global_bucket:
    data:
      # Sync all todos
      - SELECT * FROM todos
      # Sync all lists except archived ones
      - SELECT * FROM lists WHERE archived = false
```

<Note>
`global_bucket` is _not_ a reserved keyword. If no **Parameter Query** is specified in the bucket definition, the bucket is automatically a global bucket.
</Note>

<Note>
  **Note**: Table names within Sync Rules must match the names defined in the [client-side schema](/intro/setup-guide#define-your-client-side-schema).
</Note>
