title: "Migrating from Alpha to Beta"
---

### Steps to migrate

The beta version of this SDK introduces a Swift-native wrapper around the package generated from the Kotlin Multiplatform SDK, bringing a more Swift-native interface for developers. This results in several API updates from the more Kotlin-based alpha version. The main changes are:
* The `PowerSyncDatabase` no longer needs a driver argument and it must be removed.
* The interface for `PowerSyncDatabase` now uses `PowerSyncDatabaseProtocol` which may require some changes to databases uses.
* If you were using `__uploadData` and `__fetchCredentials` in your `PowerSyncBackendConnector` you must remove the `__` and update the methods to `uploadData` and `fetchCredentials`.
* `@MainThread` usage is no longer required and should be removed.
* Implementing `SuspendTaskWrapper` for database transactions is no longer required and should be removed.
