---

The PowerSync Dashboard is available in [PowerSync Cloud](https://www.powersync.com/pricing) (our cloud-hosted offering) and provides an interface for developers to:

- Manage PowerSync projects
- Manage PowerSync instances
- Write, validate and deploy [sync rules](/usage/sync-rules)
- Generate the [client-side schema](/installation/client-side-setup/define-your-schema)
- Generate [development tokens](/installation/authentication-setup/development-tokens)
- Monitor usage and configure alerts - see [Monitoring and Alerting](/usage/tools/monitoring-and-alerting)
- Review instance logs - see [Monitoring and Alerting](/usage/tools/monitoring-and-alerting)

The dashboard is available here: https://powersync.journeyapps.com/

### Hierarchy: Organization, project, instance

- After successfully [signing up](https://accounts.journeyapps.com/portal/powersync-signup?s=docs) for PowerSync Cloud, your PowerSync account is created.
- Your account is assigned an **organization** on the [Free pricing plan](https://www.powersync.com/pricing).
- A sample PowerSync **project** (named "PowerSync Project") is automatically created in this organization, and this project is your starting point after completing sign-up. It is opened by default in the dashboard:

<Frame caption="PowerSync dashboard">
  ![](/images/usage/tools/dashboard-overview.png)
</Frame>

- Within a project, you can create and manage one or more PowerSync **instances** for your project (typically developers maintain a staging and production instance). An instance runs a copy of the [PowerSync Service](/architecture/powersync-service) and connects to your [backend database](/installation/database-connection).

Here is an example of how this hierarchy might be used by a customer:

- **Organization**: Wanderlust Inc.
  - **Project**: Wanderlust Tracker
    - **Instance**: Staging
    - **Instance**: Production

### Dashboard layout

The Dashboard layout is similar to that of an IDE and includes the following main components:

- [Workspaces](/usage/tools/powersync-dashboard#workspaces)
- [Editor Panes, Panels and Files](/usage/tools/powersync-dashboard#editor-panes-panels-and-files)
- [The Command Palette](/usage/tools/powersync-dashboard#the-command-palette)
- [Actions](/usage/tools/powersync-dashboard#actions)

<Frame caption="Dashboard components">

</Frame>

#### Workspaces

Workspaces are a pre-configured logical collection of editor panes and panels that are designed to make working on a specific part of your project as easy as possible.

The dashboard comes with four workspaces by default: **Overview**, **Manage instances**, **Usage metrics** and **Instance logs**.

- The **Overview** workspace displays a summary of your PowerSync instances, or guides you through creating your first instance.
- The **Manage instances** workspace is allows you to create, view and update PowerSync instances, validate and deploy sync rules, and view deploy logs for each instance.
- The **Usage metrics** workspace displays your project's usage metrics by instance.
- The **Instance logs** workspace displays replication and service logs by instance.

You can customize any of these workspaces (changes save automatically) and/or create new workspaces.

To reset all workspaces to their original layout, run the **Reset workspaces** action (see _Command Palette_ and _Actions_ below for how to run actions).

#### Editor Panes, Panels and Files

Editor Panes are used to interact with your project's files (e.g. `sync-rules.yaml`) and Panels display information about your project in components that can be positioned and resized.

#### The Command Palette

Open the Command Palette using the keyboard shortcut `CTRL/CMD+SHIFT+P` or `SHIFT+SHIFT`, and access just about anything you need to do in your project.

#### Actions

The various actions available in your project are accessible via the Command Palette, by right-clicking on certain items, and via buttons. These are a few of the most common actions you might need during the lifecycle of your PowerSync project (you can search them via the Command Palette):

- **Generate development token** -\> Generate a [development token](/installation/authentication-setup/development-tokens) for authentication
- **Generate client-side schema** -\> Generate the [client-side schema](/installation/client-side-setup/define-your-schema) for an instance based off your [sync rules](/usage/sync-rules).
- **Validate sync rules** -\> Validate the [sync rules](/usage/sync-rules) defined in your `sync-rules.yaml` against an instance.
- **Deploy sync rules** -\> Deploy [sync rules](/usage/sync-rules) as defined in your `sync-rules.yaml` file to an instance.
- **Compare deployed sync rules** -\> Compare the [sync rules](/usage/sync-rules) as defined in your `sync-rules.yaml` file with those deployed to an instance.
- **Save changes** -\> Save changes to files as a revision when in **Basic Revisions** version control mode (see _Version Control_ below)
  - Or **Commit changes** -\> Commit changes to files when in **Advanced Git** version control mode.
- **Compact buckets** -\> Manually [compact](/usage/lifecycle-maintenance/compacting-buckets) and optionally [defragment](/usage/lifecycle-maintenance/compacting-buckets#defragmenting) sync buckets of an instance.
- **Create Personal Access Token** -\> Create an access token scoped to your user, which is needed for the [CLI](/usage/tools/cli).
- **Rename project** -\> Rename your PowerSync project.

### Dashboard Settings

To customize your dashboard experience, access the **IDE Settings** panel through the Command Palette or by clicking the gear icon located in the top-right corner of the dashboard. This panel allows you to modify core preferences, including the dashboard's theme and the display format for dates and times.

### Version Control

Your PowerSync projects come with version control built-in. This is useful when working with your project's sync rules file (`sync-rules.yaml`). The default mode is **Basic Revisions**, which allows you to save, view and revert to revisions of your sync rules file. Another mode is **Advanced Git**, which enables a git-based workflow, including commits, branching, and merging. The modes can be toggled for your projects in the Admin Portal (see [below](/usage/tools/powersync-dashboard#admin-portal)).

#### Saving/committing changes

Open the **Changes** panel (find it via the Command Palette) to review any changes and save, or revert to a specific revision/commit.

#### GitHub / Azure Repos integration

The default git provider for projects is our own "JourneyApps" system which does not require any configuration from the developer. It is also possible to use either GitHub or Azure DevOps as your git provider. For this to work, an integration must be added to your organization via the Admin Portal. Read on to learn more.

### Advanced: Service Version Locking

Customers on our [Team and Enterprise plans](https://www.powersync.com/pricing) can lock their PowerSync Cloud instances to a specific version of the PowerSync Service. This option is available under your instance settings.

Versions are specified as `major.minor.patch`. When locked, only new `.patch` releases will automatically be applied to the instance.

**Downgrade limitations:** Not all downgrade paths are available automatically. If you need to downgrade to an older version, please [contact our team](/resources/contact-us) for assistance.

### Admin Portal

In the Admin Portal you can [manage your PowerSync projects](/usage/tools/powersync-dashboard#manage-powersync-projects), [users](/usage/tools/powersync-dashboard#manage-users) and [integrations](/usage/tools/powersync-dashboard#manage-integrations).

It is available here:

https://accounts.journeyapps.com/portal/admin/

<Info>
  When in the PowerSync Dashboard, you can also click on the PowerSync icon in the top-left corner to navigate to the Admin Portal.

<Info>
  **Advanced permissions**: Several functions in the Admin Portal require advanced permissions that you do not have by default after signing up. Please [contact us](/resources/contact-us) to request these permissions. This is a temporary limitation that will be removed in a future release.
</Info>

#### Manage PowerSync projects

In the "Projects" tab, new projects can be created, existing projects can be deleted, and the [version control](/usage/tools/powersync-dashboard#version-control) mode can be changed for a project. If your project uses the **Advanced Git** version control mode, the git provider can also be configured here.

#### Manage users

Select the "Developers" tab to invite team members to your organization or remove their access. Only users with the **Owner** role can manage users.

#### Manage integrations

In the "Integrations" tab, [GitHub or Azure DevOps integrations](/usage/tools/powersync-dashboard#github-azure-repos-integration) can be added in order to configure them as git providers for your project(s).

#### Update organization settings

In the "Settings" tab, you can rename your organization.

#### Update billing details

In the "Billing" tab, you can update your billing details and manage payment cards.

**View subscriptions**

In the "Subscriptions" tab, you can view your active subscription and usage.

See [Pricing](https://www.powersync.co/pricing) for available subscription plans.
