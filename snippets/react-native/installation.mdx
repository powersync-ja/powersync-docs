<Warning>
  **PowerSync is not compatible with Expo Go.**
  PowerSync uses a native plugin and is therefore only compatible with Expo Dev Builds.
</Warning> 

Add the [PowerSync React Native NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@powersync/react-native) to your project:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="npm">
    ```bash
    npx expo install @powersync/react-native
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn expo add @powersync/react-native
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="pnpm">
    ```
    pnpm expo install @powersync/react-native
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Required peer dependencies**
  
This SDK requires [@journeyapps/react-native-quick-sqlite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@journeyapps/react-native-quick-sqlite) as a peer dependency. Install it as follows:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="npm">
    ```bash
    npx expo install @journeyapps/react-native-quick-sqlite
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn expo add @journeyapps/react-native-quick-sqlite
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="pnpm">
    ```
    pnpm expo install @journeyapps/react-native-quick-sqlite
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Alternatively, you can install OP-SQLite with the [PowerSync OP-SQLite package](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-js/tree/main/packages/powersync-op-sqlite) which offers [built-in encryption support via SQLCipher](/usage/use-case-examples/data-encryption) and a smoother transition to React Native's New Architecture.

  **Polyfills and additional notes:**
  
  - For async iterator support with watched queries, additional polyfills are required. See the [Babel plugins section](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@powersync/react-native#babel-plugins-watched-queries) in the README.
  
  - By default, this SDK connects to a PowerSync instance via WebSocket (from `@powersync/react-native@1.11.0`) or HTTP streaming (before `@powersync/react-native@1.11.0`). See [Developer Notes](/client-sdk-references/react-native-and-expo#developer-notes) for more details on connection methods and platform-specific requirements.
