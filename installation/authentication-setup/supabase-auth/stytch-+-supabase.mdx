## Consumer Authentication

See this community project for detailed setup instructions: [https://github.com/guillempuche/localfirst\_react\_server](https://github.com/guillempuche/localfirst_react_server)

## B2B SaaS Authentication

The high-level approach is:

* Users authenticate via [Stytch](https://stytch.com/)
* Extract the user and org IDs from the Stytch JWT
* Generate a Supabase JWT by calling a Supabase Edge Function that uses the Supabase JWT Secret for signing a new JWT
   * Set the `KID` in the JWT header
         * You can obtain this from any other Supabase JWT by extracting the KID value from the header â€” this value is static, even across database upgrades.
   * Set the `AUD` field to `authenticated`
   * Set the `SUB` field in the JWT payload to the user ID
* Pass this new JWT into your PowerSync `fetchCredentials` function

Use the below settings in your [PowerSync Dashboard](/usage/tools/powersync-dashboard):
