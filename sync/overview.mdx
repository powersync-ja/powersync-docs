PowerSync Sync Rules and Sync Streams allow developers to control which data gets synchronized to which clients/devices (i.e. they enable dynamic partial replication).


## Sync Rules (GA/Stable)

Sync Rules is the current GA/Stable approach to use:

## Sync Streams (Early Alpha)

[Sync Streams](/sync/streams/overview) are now available in early alpha! Sync Streams will eventually replace Sync Rules and are designed to allow for more dynamic on-demand syncing, while not compromising on the "sync data upfront" strengths of PowerSync for offline-first architecture use cases. 

Key improvements in Sync Streams over Sync Rules include:
- **On-demand syncing**: You define Sync Streams on the PowerSync Service, and a client can then subscribe to them one or more times with different parameters.
- **Temporary caching-like behavior**: Each subscription includes a configurable TTL that keeps data active after your app unsubscribes, acting as a warm cache for recently accessed data.
- **Simpler developer experience**: Simplified syntax and mental model, and capabilities such as your UI components automatically managing subscriptions (for example, React hooks).

We encourage you to explore Sync Streams for new projects, and migrating to Sync Streams once they are in Beta:
