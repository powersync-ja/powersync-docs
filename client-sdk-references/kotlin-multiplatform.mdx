  The PowerSync Swift SDK is currently in a beta release. It is suitable for production use at this stage given you've tested your use cases extensively. Breaking changes are unlikely to occur.
</Note>

### SDK Features

* Provides real-time streaming of database changes.
* Offers direct access to the SQLite database, enabling the use of SQL on both client and server sides.
* Operations are asynchronous by default, ensuring the user interface remains unblocked.
* Supports concurrent database operations, allowing one write and multiple reads simultaneously.
* Enables subscription to queries for receiving live updates.
* Eliminates the need for client-side database migrations as these are managed automatically.

Supported targets: Android and iOS.

## Installation

See the [SDK's README](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-kotlin?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) for installation instructions.

## Getting Started

Before implementing the PowerSync SDK in your project, make sure you have completed these steps:

* Signed up for a PowerSync Cloud account ([here](https://accounts.journeyapps.com/portal/get-started?powersync=true)) or [self-host PowerSync](/self-hosting/getting-started).
* [Configured your backend database](/installation/database-setup) and connected it to your PowerSync instance.
* [Installed](/client-sdk-references/kotlin-multiplatform#installation) the PowerSync SDK.

### 1\. Define the Schema

The first step is defining the schema for the local SQLite database, which is provided to the `PowerSyncDatabase` constructor via the `schema` parameter. This schema represents a "view" of the downloaded data. No migrations are required — the schema is applied directly when the PowerSync database is constructed.

The types available are `text`, `integer` and `real`. These should map directly to the values produced by the [Sync Rules](/usage/sync-rules). If a value doesn't match, it is cast automatically.

**Example**:

```kotlin
// AppSchema.kt
import com.powersync.db.schema.Column
import com.powersync.db.schema.Index
import com.powersync.db.schema.IndexedColumn
import com.powersync.db.schema.Schema
import com.powersync.db.schema.Table

val AppSchema: Schema = Schema(
    listOf(
        Table(
            name = "todos",
            columns = listOf(
                Column.text('list_id'),
                Column.text('created_at'),
                Column.text('completed_at'),
                Column.text('description'),
                Column.integer('completed'),
                Column.text('created_by'),
                Column.text('completed_by')
            ),
            // Index to allow efficient lookup within a list
            indexes = listOf(
                Index("list", listOf(IndexedColumn.descending("list_id")))
            )
        ),
        Table(
            name = "lists",
            columns = listOf(
                Column.text('created_at'),
                Column.text('name'),
                Column.text('owner_id')
            )
        )
    )
)
```
<Info>
    **Note**: No need to declare a primary key `id` column, as PowerSync will automatically create this.
</Info>

### 2\. Instantiate the PowerSync Database

Next, you need to instantiate the PowerSync database — this is the core managed database.

Its primary functions are to record all changes in the local database, whether online or offline. In addition, it automatically uploads changes to your app backend when connected.

**Example**:

a. Create platform specific `DatabaseDriverFactory` to be used by the `PowerSyncBuilder` to create the SQLite database driver.

```kotlin
// commonMain

import com.powersync.DatabaseDriverFactory
import com.powersync.PowerSyncDatabase

// Android
val driverFactory = DatabaseDriverFactory(this)
// iOS
val driverFactory = DatabaseDriverFactory()
```

b. Build a `PowerSyncDatabase` instance using the `PowerSyncBuilder` and the `DatabaseDriverFactory`. The schema you created in a previous step is provided as a parameter:

```kotlin
// commonMain

// Uses the backend connector that will be created in the next step
database.connect(MyConnector())
```

c. Connect the `PowerSyncDatabase` to the backend connector:

```kotlin
// commonMain

// Uses the backend connector that will be created in the next step
database.connect(MyConnector())
```

**Special case: Compose Multiplatform**

The artifact `com.powersync:powersync-compose` provides a simpler API:

```kotlin
// commonMain
val database = rememberPowerSyncDatabase(schema)
remember {
    database.connect(MyConnector())
}
```

### 3\. Integrate with your Backend

Create a connector to integrate with your backend. The PowerSync backend connector provides the connection between your application backend and the PowerSync managed database.

It is used to:

1. Retrieve an auth token to connect to the PowerSync instance.
2. Apply local changes on your backend application server (and from there, to Postgres)

Accordingly, the connector must implement two methods:

1. `PowerSyncBackendConnector.fetchCredentials` \- This is called every couple of minutes and is used to obtain credentials for your app backend API. -> See [Authentication Setup](/installation/authentication-setup) for instructions on how the credentials should be generated.
2. `PowerSyncBackendConnector.uploadData` \- Use this to upload client-side changes to your app backend.
\-> See [Writing Client Changes](/installation/app-backend-setup/writing-client-changes) for considerations on the app backend implementation.

**Example**:

```kotlin
// PowerSync.kt
import com.powersync.DatabaseDriverFactory
import com.powersync.PowerSyncDatabase

class MyConnector : PowerSyncBackendConnector() {
    override suspend fun fetchCredentials(): PowerSyncCredentials {
        // implement fetchCredentials to obtain the necessary credentials to connect to your backend
        // See an example implementation in https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-kotlin/blob/main/connectors/supabase/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/powersync/connector/supabase/SupabaseConnector.kt

        return {
            endpoint: '[Your PowerSync instance URL or self-hosted endpoint]',
            // Use a development token (see Authentication Setup https://docs.powersync.com/installation/authentication-setup/development-tokens) to get up and running quickly) to get up and running quickly
            token: 'An authentication token'
        }
    }

    override suspend fun uploadData(database: PowerSyncDatabase) {
        // Implement uploadData to send local changes to your backend service
        // You can omit this method if you only want to sync data from the server to the client
        // See an example implementation under Usage Examples (sub-page)
        // See https://docs.powersync.com/installation/app-backend-setup/writing-client-changes for considerations.
    }
}
```

**Note**: If you are using Supabase, you can use [SupabaseConnector.kt](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-kotlin/blob/main/connectors/supabase/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/powersync/connector/supabase/SupabaseConnector.kt) as a starting point.

## Using PowerSync: CRUD functions

Once the PowerSync instance is configured you can start using the SQLite DB functions.

The most commonly used CRUD functions to interact with your SQLite data are:

* [PowerSyncDatabase.get](/client-sdk-references/kotlin-multiplatform#fetching-a-single-item) \- get (SELECT) a single row from a table.
* [PowerSyncDatabase.getAll](/client-sdk-references/kotlin-multiplatform#querying-items-powersync-getall) \- get (SELECT) a set of rows from a table.
* [PowerSyncDatabase.watch](/client-sdk-references/kotlin-multiplatform#watching-queries-powersync-watch) \- execute a read query every time source tables are modified.
* [PowerSyncDatabase.execute](/client-sdk-references/kotlin-multiplatform#mutations-powersync-execute) \- execute a write (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) query.

### Fetching a Single Item

The `get` method executes a read-only (SELECT) query and returns a single result. It throws an exception if no result is found. Use `getOptional` to return a single optional result (returns `null` if no result is found).

```kotlin
// Find a list item by ID
suspend fun find(id: Any): TodoList {
    val results = db.get("SELECT * FROM lists WHERE id = ?", listOf(id))
    return TodoList.fromRow(results)
}
```

### Querying Items (PowerSync.getAll)

The `getAll` method executes a read-only (SELECT) query and returns a set of rows.

```kotlin
// Get all list IDs
suspend fun getLists(): List<String> {
    val results = db.getAll("SELECT id FROM lists WHERE id IS NOT NULL")
    return results.map { row -> row["id"] as String }.toList()
}
```

### Watching Queries (PowerSync.watch)

The `watch` method executes a read query whenever a change to a dependent table is made.

```kotlin
// You can watch any SQL query
fun watchCustomers(): Flow<List<User>> {
    // TODO: implement your UI based on the result set
    return database.watch("SELECT * FROM customers", mapper = { cursor ->
        User(
            id = cursor.getString(0)!!,
            name = cursor.getString(1)!!,
            email = cursor.getString(2)!!
        )
    })
}
```

### Mutations (PowerSync.execute)

The `execute` method executes a write query (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) and returns the results (if any).

```kotlin
suspend fun insertCustomer(name: String, email: String) {
    database.writeTransaction {
        database.execute(
            sql = "INSERT INTO customers (id, name, email) VALUES (uuid(), ?, ?)",
            parameters = listOf(name, email)
        )
    }
}

suspend fun updateCustomer(id: String, name: String, email: String) {
    database.execute(
        sql = "UPDATE customers SET name = ? WHERE email = ?",
        parameters = listOf(name, email)
    )
}

suspend fun deleteCustomer(id: String? = null) {
    // If no id is provided, delete the first customer in the database
    val targetId =
        id ?: database.getOptional(
            sql = "SELECT id FROM customers LIMIT 1",
            mapper = { cursor ->
                cursor.getString(0)!!
            }
        ) ?: return

    database.writeTransaction {
        database.execute(
            sql = "DELETE FROM customers WHERE id = ?",
            parameters = listOf(targetId)
        )
    }
}
```
