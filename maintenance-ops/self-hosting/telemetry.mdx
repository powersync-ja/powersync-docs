## Overview

PowerSync uses OpenTelemetry to gather metrics about usage and health.

This telemetry is shared with the PowerSync team unless you opt-out. This allows us to gauge adoption and usage patterns across deployments so that so that we can better allocate R&D capacity and ultimately better serve our customers (including you!). The metrics are linked to a random UUID and are therefore completely anonymous.

## What is Collected

Below are the data points collected every few minutes and associated with a random UUID representing your instance:

<Note>Type definitions for each metric dimension are available in the [powersync-service](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-service/blob/main/packages/types/src/metrics.ts) repository.</Note>

| Dimension                         | Type    |
| --------------------------------- | ------- |
| data\_replicated\_bytes           | counter |
| data\_synced\_bytes               | counter |
| rows\_replicated\_total           | counter |
| transactions\_replicated\_total   | counter |
| chunks\_replicated\_total         | counter |
| operations\_synced\_total         | counter |
| replication\_storage\_size\_bytes | gauge   |
| operation\_storage\_size\_bytes   | gauge   |
| parameter\_storage\_size\_bytes   | gauge   |
| concurrent\_connections           | gauge   |

<Tip>To scrape your self-hosted PowerSync Service metrics, please see the [Metrics](/maintenance-ops/self-hosting/metrics) docs page for more details.</Tip>

### Opting Out

To disable the sending of telemetry to PowerSync, set the `disable_telemetry_sharing` key in your [configuration file](/configuration/powersync-service/self-hosted-service) (`config.yaml` or `config.json`) to `true`:

```yaml powersync.yaml
telemetry:
    # Opt out of reporting anonymized usage metrics to PowerSync telemetry service
    disable_telemetry_sharing: true
```
