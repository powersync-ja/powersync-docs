Add the [PowerSync React Native NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@powersync/react-native) to your project:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="npm">
    ```bash
    npx expo install @powersync/react-native
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn expo add @powersync/react-native
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="pnpm">
    ```
    pnpm expo install @powersync/react-native
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Database Adapter Installation

PowerSync requires a SQLite database adapter. Choose based on your development and deployment needs:

#### For Development and Testing with Expo Go

Install the [@powersync/dev package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@powersync/dev) for Expo Go compatibility:

  <Tabs>
    <Tab title="npm">
      ```bash
      npx expo install @powersync/dev
      ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="yarn">
      ```bash
      yarn expo add @powersync/dev
      ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="pnpm">
      ```
      pnpm expo install @powersync/dev
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

See the [Expo Go Support documentation](/client-sdk-references/react-native-and-expo/expo-go-support) for additional setup details.

<Warning>
**Development Use Only**

The @powersync/dev package is designed for development and testing purposes only. It will perform much slower than native database adapters.
</Warning>

#### For Production Use Cases

Choose between these native database adapters:

**OP-SQLite (Recommended)**

The [PowerSync OP-SQLite package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@powersync/op-sqlite) offers:
- Built-in encryption support via SQLCipher
- Smoother transition to React Native's New Architecture

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="npm">
    ```bash
    npx expo install @powersync/op-sqlite @op-engineering/op-sqlite
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn expo add @powersync/op-sqlite @op-engineering/op-sqlite
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="pnpm">
    ```
    pnpm expo install @powersync/op-sqlite @op-engineering/op-sqlite
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**React Native Quick SQLite**

The [@journeyapps/react-native-quick-sqlite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@journeyapps/react-native-quick-sqlite) package is the original database adapter for React Native and therefore more battle-tested in production environments.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="npm">
    ```bash
    npx expo install @journeyapps/react-native-quick-sqlite
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn expo add @journeyapps/react-native-quick-sqlite
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="pnpm">
    ```
    pnpm expo install @journeyapps/react-native-quick-sqlite
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
  **Polyfills and additional notes:**
  
  - For async iterator support with watched queries, additional polyfills are required. See the [Babel plugins section](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@powersync/react-native#babel-plugins-watched-queries) in the README.
  
  - By default, this SDK connects to a PowerSync instance via WebSocket (from `@powersync/react-native@1.11.0`) or HTTP streaming (before `@powersync/react-native@1.11.0`). See [Developer Notes](/client-sdk-references/react-native-and-expo#developer-notes) for more details on connection methods and platform-specific requirements.

  - When using the OP-SQLite package, we recommend adding this [metro config](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-js/tree/main/packages/react-native#metro-config-optional)
    to avoid build issues.
