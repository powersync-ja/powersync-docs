The `@powersync/react` package provides React hooks for use with the [JavaScript Web SDK](./) or [React Native SDK](../react-native-and-expo/). These hooks are designed to support reactivity, and can be used to automatically re-render React components when query results update or to access PowerSync connectivity status changes.

The main hooks available are:

* `useQuery`: This allows you to access the results of a watched query. The response includes `isLoading`, `isFetching` and `error` properties.

* `useStatus`: Access the PowerSync connectivity status. This can be used to update the UI based on whether the client is connected or not.

* `useSuspenseQuery`: This hook also allows you to access the results of a watched query, but its loading and fetching states are handled through [Suspense](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense). It automatically converts certain loading/fetching states into Suspense signals, triggering Suspense boundaries in parent components.

<Note>
For advanced watch query features like incremental updates and differential results for React Hooks, see [Live Queries / Watch Queries](/usage/use-case-examples/watch-queries).
