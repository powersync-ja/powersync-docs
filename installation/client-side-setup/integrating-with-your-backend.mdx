description: "The PowerSync 'backend connector' provides the connection between your application backend and the PowerSync client-slide managed SQLite database."

It is used to:

1. Retrieve a JWT token which can be used by the PowerSync Client SDK to authenticate against your [PowerSync Service](/architecture/powersync-service) instance.
2. Upload writes to your backend: Writes that are made to the local SQLite database are sent to your backend application, where you control how they're applied to your backend database (Postgres, MongoDB or MySQL)

Accordingly, the connector must implement two methods:

1. `fetchCredentials()` — This is called every couple of minutes and is used to obtain JWT credentials from your app backend API. See [Authentication Setup](/installation/authentication-setup) for instructions on how the credentials should be generated.
2. `uploadData()` — Use this to upload client-side changes to your app backend.
See [Writing Client Changes](/installation/app-backend-setup/writing-client-changes) for considerations on the app backend implementation.
