title: "Define your Schema"
---

The PowerSync Client SDKs expose a managed SQLite database that your app can read from and write to. The client-side schema refers to the schema for that SQLite database.

The client-side schema is typically mainly derived from your backend database schema and [Sync Rules](/usage/sync-rules), but can also include other tables such as local-only tables. 

Note that schema migrations are not required on the SQLite database due to the schemaless nature of the [PowerSync protocol](/architecture/powersync-protocol): schemaless data is synced to the client-side SQLite database, and the client-side schema is then applied to that data using _SQLite views_ to allow for structured querying of the data.

<Info>
**Generate schema automatically (PowerSync Cloud)**

In the [PowerSync Dashboard](/usage/tools/powersync-dashboard), the schema can be generated based off your [Sync Rules](/usage/sync-rules) by right-clicking on an instance and selecting **Generate client-side schema**.

Similar functionality exists in the PowerSync [CLI](/usage/tools/cli).

**Note:** The generated schema will exclude an `id` column, as the client SDK automatically creates an `id` column of type `text`. Consequently, it is not necessary to specify an `id` column in your schema. For additional information on IDs, refer to [Client ID](/usage/sync-rules/client-id).

## Example implementation

For an example implementation of the client-side schema, see the _Getting Started_ section of the SDK reference for your platform:
