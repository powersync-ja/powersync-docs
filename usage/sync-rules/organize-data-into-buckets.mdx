title: "Organize Data Into Buckets"
---

To sync different sets of data to each user, data is organized into buckets.

Each user can sync a number of buckets (up to 1,000), and each bucket defines a set of tables/collections and rows/documents to sync.

  <Tab title="Sync Streams">
    With Sync Streams, you define streams that clients can subscribe to with parameters:

    ```yaml
    config:
      edition: 2
    streams:
      user_lists:
        priority: 1 # See https://docs.powersync.com/usage/use-case-examples/prioritized-sync
        query: SELECT * FROM lists WHERE owner_id = auth.user_id()
    ```

    Clients then subscribe to streams with parameters as needed. See the [Sync Streams documentation](/usage/sync-streams.md) for client-side syntax.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Sync Rules (legacy)">
    With Sync Rules, this is defined using two queries:

    1. Select bucket parameters from a user ID and/or other parameters ([parameter queries](/usage/sync-rules/parameter-queries))

    2. Select data in the bucket using the bucket parameters ([data queries](/usage/sync-rules/data-queries))

    When designing your buckets, it is recommended, but not required, to group all data in a bucket where the same parameters apply.

    An example:

    ```yaml
    bucket_definitions:
      user_lists:
        # Optionally define the priority of the bucket to sync certain buckets before others
        priority: 1 # See https://docs.powersync.com/usage/use-case-examples/prioritized-sync  
        # Select parameters for the bucket, using the current user_id
        parameters: SELECT request.user_id() as user_id # (request.user_id() comes from the JWT token)  
        data:
          # Select data rows/documents using the parameters above
          - SELECT * FROM lists WHERE owner_id = bucket.user_id
    ```
  </Tab>
