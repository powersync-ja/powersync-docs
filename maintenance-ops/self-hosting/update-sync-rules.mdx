description: "How to update Sync Streams (or legacy Sync Rules) in a self-hosted PowerSync deployment"
---

There are two ways to update Sync Streams (or legacy Sync Rules) in a self-hosted deployment:

1. **Config file** - Update your config and restart the service
2. **API endpoint** - Deploy at runtime without restarting

<Info>
  During deployment, the existing version of your Sync Streams / Sync Rules continue serving clients while the new version is processed. 
  Clients seamlessly transition once [initial replication](/architecture/powersync-service#initial-replication-vs-incremental-replication)
  completes.
</Info>

## Option 1: Config File (Recommended)

Define Sync Streams (or legacy Sync Rules) in your `powersync.yaml` via a separate file (recommended) or inline.

See [Self-Hosted Instance Configuration](/configuration/powersync-service/self-hosted-instances) for the full config reference and [Sync Streams](/sync/streams/overview) (or legacy [Sync Rules](/sync/rules/overview)) for syntax.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Edit Config">
    Update the `sync_config:` section in your `powersync.yaml`. The `sync_config:` key is used for both Sync Streams and Sync Rules:
    <CodeGroup>
      ```yaml Sync Streams — Separate File (Recommended)
      sync_config:
        path: sync-config.yaml
      ```

      ```yaml Sync Streams — Inline
      sync_config:
        content: |
          config:
            edition: 3
          streams:
            users:
              auto_subscribe: true
              query: SELECT * FROM public.users
      ```

      ```yaml Sync Rules — Separate File (Legacy)
      sync_config:
        path: sync-config.yaml
      ```

      ```yaml Sync Rules — Inline (Legacy)
      sync_config:
        content: |
          bucket_definitions:
            global:
              data:
                - SELECT * FROM public.users
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Restart Service">
    Restart your service to apply changes:

    ```shell
    docker compose restart powersync
    ```

    Once the service starts up, it will load the updated Sync Streams / Sync Rules and begin processing them while continuing to serve the existing version until initial replication completes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Option 2: Deploy via API

Deploy Sync Streams (or legacy Sync Rules) at runtime without restarting. Useful for quick iterations during development.

<Warning>
  The API is disabled when Sync Streams (or legacy Sync Rules) are defined in `powersync.yaml`.
  Sync Streams (or legacy Sync Rules) defined in `powersync.yaml` always take precedence.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure API Token">
    Add an API token to your `powersync.yaml` and restart:

    ```yaml powersync.yaml
    api:
      tokens:
        - !env PS_API_TOKEN
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy Sync Streams / Sync Rules">
    ```shell
    curl -X POST http://<host>:<port>/api/sync-rules/v1/deploy \
         -H "Content-Type: application/yaml" \
         -H "Authorization: Bearer ${PS_API_TOKEN}" \
         -d @sync-rules.yaml
    ```

    Use `/api/sync-rules/v1/validate` first to check for errors without deploying.

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Additional Endpoints

| Endpoint                       | Method | Description                       |
| ------------------------------ | ------ | --------------------------------- |
| `/api/sync-rules/v1/current`   | GET    | Get active and pending Sync Streams / Sync Rules |
| `/api/sync-rules/v1/reprocess` | POST   | Restart replication from scratch  |

## Troubleshooting

Common errors when using the API:

| Error Code    | Meaning                                             |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `PSYNC_S4105` | Sync Streams / Sync Rules defined in config file - API is disabled |
| `PSYNC_S4104` | No Sync Streams / Sync Rules deployed yet                          |
| `PSYNC_R0001` | Invalid Sync Streams / Sync Rules YAML - check `details` field     |
