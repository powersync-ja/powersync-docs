title: "CLI (Beta)"
description: "Manage your PowerSync Cloud environment programmatically"
---

You can use the [PowerSync CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/powersync) to manage your PowerSync Cloud instances from your machine. Specifically, you can:

* Manage your [PowerSync instances ](/architecture/powersync-service)(PowerSync Cloud)
* Validate and deploy [sync rules](/usage/sync-rules) to an instance from a local file
* Generate the [client-side schema](/installation/client-side-setup/define-your-schema)

<Note>
  The PowerSync CLI is not yet compatible with managing [self-hosted](/self-hosting/getting-started) PowerSync instances (PowerSync Open Edition and PowerSync Enterprise Self-Hosted Edition). This is on our roadmap.
</Note>

### Getting started

To begin, initialize the CLI via `npx`:

```bash
npx powersync init
```

### Personal Access Token

```bash
npx powersync init

? Enter your API token: [hidden]
```

You need to provide an access (API) token to initialize the CLI. These can be created in the [Dashboard](/usage/tools/powersync-dashboard), using the **Create Personal Access Token** action (search for it using the [command palette](/usage/tools/powersync-dashboard#the-command-palette)).

Use the **Revoke Personal Access Token** action to revoke access.

### Known issues and limitations

* When deploying sync rules from the CLI, the `sync-rules.yaml` file shown in the [PowerSync Dashboard](/usage/tools/powersync-dashboard) could be out of date. You can run the **Compare deployed sync rules** [action](/usage/tools/powersync-dashboard#actions) in the Dashboard to review the latest deployed sync rules.
* Certificates cannot currently be managed from the CLI.
* The PowerSync CLI is not yet compatible with managing [self-hosted](/self-hosting/getting-started) PowerSync instances (PowerSync Open Edition and PowerSync Enterprise Self-Hosted Edition). This is on our roadmap.
