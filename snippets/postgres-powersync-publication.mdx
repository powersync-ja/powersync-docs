```sql
-- Create a publication to replicate tables. The publication must be named "powersync"
CREATE PUBLICATION powersync FOR ALL TABLES;
```

<Warning>
Note that the PowerSync Service has to read all updates present in the publication's WAL, regardless of whether the table is referenced in your Sync Streams / Sync Rules definitions. This can cause large spikes in memory usage or introduce replication delays, so if you're dealing with large data volumes then you'll want to specify a comma separated subset of tables to replicate instead of `FOR ALL TABLES`.

<Warning>
The snippet above replicates all tables and is the simplest way to get started in a dev environment.
