* **Real-time streaming of database changes**: Changes made by one user are instantly streamed to all other users with access to that data. This keeps clients automatically in sync without manual polling or refresh logic.
* **Direct access to a local SQLite database**: Data is stored locally, so apps can read and write instantly without network calls. This enables offline support and faster user interactions.
* **Asynchronous background execution**: The SDK performs database operations in the background to avoid blocking the applicationâ€™s main thread. This means that apps stay responsive, even during heavy data activity.
* **Query subscriptions for live updates**: The SDK supports query subscriptions that automatically push real-time updates to client applications as data changes, keeping your UI reactive and up to date. 
* **Automatic schema management**: PowerSync syncs schemaless data and applies a client-defined schema using SQLite views. This architecture means that PowerSync SDKs can handle schema changes gracefully without requiring explicit migrations on the client-side.
