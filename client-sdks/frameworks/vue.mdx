The [`powersync/vue`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@powersync/vue) package is a Vue-specific wrapper for PowerSync. It provides Vue [composables](https://vuejs.org/guide/reusability/composables) that are designed to support reactivity, and can be used to automatically re-render components when query results update or to access PowerSync connectivity status changes.

The main hooks available are:

* `useQuery`: This allows you to access the results of a watched query. The response includes `isLoading`, `isFetching` and `error` properties.

* `useStatus`: Access the PowerSync connectivity status. This can be used to update the UI based on whether the client is connected or not.

<Note>
For advanced watch query features like incremental updates and differential results for Vue Hooks, see [Live Queries / Watch Queries](/client-sdks/watch-queries).
