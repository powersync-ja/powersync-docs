<Note>
Web support for Flutter in version `^1.9.0` is currently in a **beta** release. It is functionally ready for production use, provided that you've tested your use cases. 

Please see the [Limitations](#limitations) detailed below.
</Note>

## Demo app

The easiest way to test Flutter Web support is to run the [Supabase Todo-List](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync.dart/tree/main/demos/supabase-todolist) demo app:

1. Clone the [powersync.dart](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync.dart/tree/main) repo.
   1. **Note**: If you are an existing user updating to the latest code after a git pull, run `melos exec 'flutter pub upgrade'` in the repo's root and make sure it succeeds.
2. Run `melos prepare` in the repo's root
3. cd into the `demos/supabase-todolist` folder
4. If you havenâ€™t yet: `cp lib/app_config_template.dart lib/app_config.dart` (optionally update this config with your own Supabase and PowerSync project details).
5. Run `flutter run -d chrome`

## Installing PowerSync in your own project

Install the [latest version](https://pub.dev/packages/powersync/versions) of the package, for example:

```bash
flutter pub add powersync:'^1.9.0'
```

### Additional config

#### Assets
Web support requires `sqlite3.wasm` and worker (`powersync_db.worker.js` and `powersync_sync.worker.js`) assets to be served from the web application. They can be downloaded to the web directory by running the following command in your application's root folder.

```bash
dart run powersync:setup_web
```

The same code is used for initializing native and web `PowerSyncDatabase` clients.

#### OPFS for improved performance

This SDK supports different storage modes of the SQLite database with varying levels of performance and compatibility:

- **IndexedDB**: Highly compatible with different browsers, but performance is slow.
- **OPFS** (Origin-Private File System): Significantly faster but requires additional configuration.

OPFS is the preferred mode when it is available. Otherwise database storage falls back to IndexedDB.

Enabling OPFS requires adding two headers to the HTTP server response when a client requests the Flutter web application:

- `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy`: Needs to be set to `same-origin`.
- `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy`: Needs to be set to `require-corp`.

When running the app locally, you can use the following command to include the required headers:

```bash
flutter run -d chrome --web-header "Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy=same-origin" --web-header "Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy=require-corp"
```

When serving a Flutter Web app in production, the [Flutter docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/web#building-the-app-for-release) recommend building the web app with `flutter build web`, then serving the content with an HTTP server. The server should be configured to use the above headers.

<Tip>
**Further reading**:

[Drift](https://drift.simonbinder.eu/) uses the same packages as our [`sqlite_async`](https://github.com/powersync-ja/sqlite_async.dart) package under the hood, and has excellent documentation for how the web filesystem is selected. See [here](https://drift.simonbinder.eu/platforms/web/) for web compatibility notes and [here](https://drift.simonbinder.eu/platforms/web/#additional-headers) for additional notes on the required web headers.

## Limitations

The API for Web is essentially the same as for native platforms, however, some features within `PowerSyncDatabase` clients are not available.

### Imports

Flutter Web does not support importing directly from `sqlite3.dart` as it uses `dart:ffi`.

Change imports from:

```dart
import 'package/powersync/sqlite3.dart`
```

to:

```dart
import 'package/powersync/sqlite3_common.dart'
```

in code which needs to run on the Web platform. Isolated native-specific code can still import from `sqlite3.dart`.

### Database connections

Web database connections do not support concurrency. A single database connection is used. `readLock` and `writeLock` contexts do not implement checks for preventing writable queries in read connections and vice-versa.

Direct access to the synchronous `CommonDatabase` (`sqlite.Database` equivalent for web) connection is not available. `computeWithDatabase` is not available on web.
