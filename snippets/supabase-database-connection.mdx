1. From your Supabase Dashboard, select **Connect** in the top navigation bar (or follow this [link](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_?showConnect=true)):

    </Frame>

3. In the [PowerSync Dashboard](https://dashboard.powersync.com/), select your project and instance and go to **Database Connections**.
4. Click **Connect to Source Database** and ensure the **Postgres** tab is selected.
4. Paste the connection string into the **URI** field. PowerSync will automatically parse this URI to populate the database connection details.
5. Update the **Username** and **Password** fields to use the `powersync_role` and password you created when configuring your Supabase for PowerSync (see [Source Database Setup](/configuration/source-db/setup#supabase)). 
6. Note: PowerSync includes Supabase's CA certificate by default, so you can use `verify-full` SSL mode without additional configuration.

7. Verify your setup by clicking **Test Connection** and resolve any errors.
8. Click **Save Connection**.

PowerSync will now create an isolated cloud environment for your instance. This typically takes a minute or two.

### Enable Supabase Auth

After your database connection is configured, enable Supabase Auth:

1. In the PowerSync Dashboard, go to **Client Auth** for your instance.
2. Enable the **Use Supabase Auth** checkbox.
3. If your Supabase project uses the legacy JWT signing keys, copy your JWT Secret from your Supabase project's settings ([JWT Keys](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/jwt)) and paste the secret into the **Supabase JWT Secret (optional) Legacy** field in the PowerSync Dashboard. If you're using Supabase's new [JWT signing keys](https://supabase.com/blog/jwt-signing-keys), you can leave this field empty (PowerSync will auto-configure the JWKS endpoint for your project).
4. Click **Save and Deploy** to apply the changes.
