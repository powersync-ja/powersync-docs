Join tables are often used to implement many-to-many relationships between tables. Join queries are not directly supported in PowerSync Sync Rules, and require some workarounds depending on the use case. This guide contains some recommended strategies.

<Note>
  **Postgres users:** For Postgres source databases, you can use the [`pg_ivm` extension](https://www.powersync.com/blog/using-pg-ivm-to-enable-joins-in-powersync) to create incrementally maintained materialized views with JOINs that can be referenced directly in Sync Rules. This approach avoids the need to denormalize your schema.

## Example

As an example, consider a social media application. The app has message boards. Each user can subscribe to boards, make posts, and comment on posts. Posts may also have one or more topics.

### Many-to-many: Bucket parameters

For this app, we generally want to sync all posts in boards that users have subscribed to. To simplify these examples, we assume a user has to be subscribed to a board to post.

Boards make a nice grouping of data for Sync Rules: We sync the boards that a user has subscribed to, and the same board data is synced to all users subscribed to that board.

The relationship between users and boards is a many-to-many, specified via the `board_subscriptions` table.

To start with, in our PowerSync Sync Rules, we define a [bucket](/sync/rules/buckets) and sync the posts. The [parameter query](/sync/rules/parameter-queries) is defined using the `board_subscriptions` table:

```yaml
  board_data:
    parameters: select board_id from board_subscriptions where user_id = request.user_id()
    data:
      - select * from posts where board_id = bucket.board_id
```

### Avoiding joins in data queries: Denormalize relationships (comments)

Next, we also want to sync comments for those boards. There is a one-to-many relationship between boards and comments, via the `posts` table. This means conceptually we can add comments to the same board bucket. With general SQL, the query could be:

```sql
SELECT comments.* FROM comments
JOIN posts ON posts.id = comments.post_id
WHERE board_id = bucket.board_id
```

Unfortunately, joins are not supported in PowerSync's Sync Rules. Instead, we denormalize the data to add a direct foreign key relationship between comments and boards: (Postgres example)

```sql
ALTER TABLE comments ADD COLUMN board_id uuid;
ALTER TABLE comments ADD CONSTRAINT comments_board_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (board_id) REFERENCES boards (id);
```

Now we can add it to the bucket definition in our Sync Rules:

```yaml
  board_data:
    parameters: select board_id from board_subscriptions where user_id = request.user_id()
    data:
      - select * from posts where board_id = bucket.board_id
      # Add comments:
      - select * from comments where board_id = bucket.board_id
```

Now we want to sync topics of posts. In this case we added `board_id` from the start, so `post_topics` is simple in our Sync Rules:

```yaml
  board_data:
    parameters: select board_id from board_subscriptions where user_id = request.user_id()
    data:
      - select * from posts where board_id = bucket.board_id
      - select * from comments where board_id = bucket.board_id
      # Add post_topics:
      - select * from post_topics where board_id = bucket.board_id
```

### Many-to-many strategy: Sync everything (topics)

Now we need access to sync the topics for all posts synced to the device. There is a many-to-many relationship between posts and topics, and by extension boards to topics. This means there is no simple direct way to partition topics into buckets — the same topics be used on any number of boards.

If the topics table is limited in size (say 1,000 or less), the simplest solution is to just sync all topics in our Sync Rules:

```yaml
  global_topics:
    data:
      - select * from topics where board_id = bucket.board_id
```

### Many-to-many strategy: Denormalize data (topics, user names)

If there are many thousands of topics, we may want to avoid syncing everything. One option is to denormalize the data by copying the topic label over to `post_topics`: (Postgres example)

```sql
ALTER TABLE post_topics ADD COLUMN topic_label text not null;
```

Now we don't need to sync the `topics` table itself, as everything is included in `post_topics`. Assuming the topic label never or rarely changes, this could be a good solution.

Next up, we want to sync the relevant user profiles, so we can show it together with comments and posts. For simplicity, we sync profiles for all users subscribed to a board.

One option is to add the author name to each board subscription, similar to what we've done for `topics`: (Postgres example)

```sql
ALTER TABLE board_subscriptions ADD COLUMN user_name text;
```

Sync Rules:

```yaml
  board_data:
    parameters: select board_id from board_subscriptions where user_id = request.user_id()
    data:
      - select * from posts where board_id = bucket.board_id
      - select * from comments where board_id = bucket.board_id
      - select * from post_topics where board_id = bucket.board_id
      # Add subscriptions which include the names:
      - select * from board_subscriptions where board_id = bucket.board_id
```

### Many-to-many strategy: Array of IDs (user profiles)

If we need to sync more than just the name (let's say we need a last activity date, profile picture and bio text as well), the above approach doesn't scale as well. Instead, we want to sync the `users` table directly. To sync user profiles directly in the bucket for the board, we need a new array.

Adding an array to the schema in Postgres:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN subscribed_board_ids uuid[];
```

By using an array instead of or in addition to a join table, we can use it directly in Sync Rules:

```yaml
board_data:
  parameters: select board_id from board_subscriptions where user_id = request.user_id()
  data:
    - select * from posts where board_id = bucket.board_id
    - select * from comments where board_id = bucket.board_id
    - select * from post_topics where board_id = bucket.board_id
    # Add participating users:
    - select name, last_activity, profile_picture, bio from users where bucket.board_id in subscribed_board_ids
```

This approach does require some extra effort to keep the array up to date. One option is to use a trigger in the case of Postgres:

<Accordion
  title="Postgres trigger to update subscribed_board_ids"
>
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION recalculate_subscribed_boards()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Recalculate subscribed_board_ids for the affected user
    UPDATE users
    SET subscribed_board_ids = (
        SELECT array_agg(board_id)
        FROM board_subscriptions
        WHERE user_id = COALESCE(NEW.user_id, OLD.user_id)
    )
    WHERE id = COALESCE(NEW.user_id, OLD.user_id);

    RETURN NULL;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER trg_board_subscriptions_change
AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON board_subscriptions
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION recalculate_subscribed_boards();
```
</Accordion>

Note that this approach does have scaling limitations. When the number of board subscriptions per user becomes large (say over 100 rows per user), then:

1. Updating the `subscribed_board_ids` array in Postgres becomes slower.
2. The overhead is even more pronounced on PowerSync, since PowerSync maintains a separate copy of the data in each bucket.

In those cases, another approach may be more suitable.
