description: "Setting up Firebase Authentication with PowerSync"
---

Configure authentication on the PowerSync instance with the following settings:

* JWKS URI: [https://www.googleapis.com/service\_accounts/v1/jwk/securetoken@system.gserviceaccount.com](https://www.googleapis.com/service_accounts/v1/jwk/securetoken@system.gserviceaccount.com)
* JWT Audience: Firebase project ID

Firebase signs these tokens using RS256.

PowerSync will periodically refresh the keys using the above JWKS URI, and validate tokens against the configured audience (token `aud` value).

The Firebase user UID will be available as `request.user_id()` (previously `token_parameters.user_id`.). To use a different identifier as the user ID in sync rules (for example user email), use [Custom authentication](/installation/authentication-setup/custom).
