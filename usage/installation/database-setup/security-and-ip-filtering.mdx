## TLS with Postgres

PowerSync always [enforces TLS](/usage/lifecycle-maintenance/postgres-maintenance#tls) on connections to the database, and certificate validation cannot be disabled.

## PowerSync Cloud: IP Filtering

For additional peace of mind, access to the database may be limited to the following IP addresses if you are using **PowerSync Cloud**:

### US Region

```
50.19.5.255

34.193.39.149

18.234.18.91

18.233.128.219

34.202.251.156
```

### EU Region

```
79.125.70.43

18.200.209.88

18.234.18.91

18.233.128.219

34.202.251.156
```

### JP Region

```
54.248.194.85

57.180.73.135

18.234.18.91

18.233.128.219

34.202.251.156
```

### IPv6 - All regions

```
2602:817::/44
```

Do not rely on IP filtering as a primary form of security. Always use strong database passwords, and use client certificates if additional security is required.
