```sql
-- Create a role/user with replication privileges for PowerSync
CREATE ROLE powersync_role WITH REPLICATION BYPASSRLS LOGIN PASSWORD 'myhighlyrandompassword';
-- Set up permissions for the newly created role
-- Read-only (SELECT) access is required
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO powersync_role;  

-- Optionally, grant SELECT on all future tables (to cater for schema additions)
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO powersync_role; 
```

To restrict read access to specific tables, explicitly list allowed tables for both the `SELECT` privilege, and for the publication mentioned in the next step (as well as for any other publications that may exist).
