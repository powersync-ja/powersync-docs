<Info>
The PowerSync Open Edition is currently considered a beta release as it still requires more detailed documentation and guides.

From a stability perspective the Open Edition is production-ready as it uses the same codebase as our Cloud version.

Please reach out on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/powersync) if you have any questions not yet covered in these docs.
</Info>

The [PowerSync Service](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-service) can be self-hosted using Docker. It is published to Docker Hub as [journeyapps/powersync-service](https://hub.docker.com/r/journeyapps/powersync-service)

Note that the [PowerSync Dashboard](/usage/tools/powersync-dashboard) is currently not available in the PowerSync Open Edition.

We have five starting points, detailed below:

## Demo Project (5 minutes)

The quickest way to get a feel for the system is to run our example project on your development machine using Docker Compose. You can find it [here](https://github.com/powersync-ja/self-host-demo):

## Local Development With Docker Compose (variable)

If you plan to self-host for development purposes only, we have a section describing how to easily do this using Docker Compose:

[Local Development](/self-hosting/local-development)

## Deployment Templates (15 minutes)

Some deployment templates are coming in the future.

## Installation (1 hour)

See our [Installation](/self-hosting/installation) section for instructions to run the PowerSync Service in a production environment.
