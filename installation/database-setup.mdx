Configuring your Postgres database with PowerSync generally involves three tasks:

1. Enable logical replication
2. Create a PowerSync database user
3. Create `powersync` publication

We have documented steps for some hosting providers:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Supabase">
    ### 1. Enable logical replication

    Supabase has logical replication enabled by default — no action required.

    ### 2. Create a PowerSync Database User

    <PostgresPowerSyncUser />

    ### 3. Create "powersync" Publication

    <PostgresPowerSyncPublication />
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="AWS RDS">
    ### Prerequisites

    The instance must be publicly accessible using an IPv4 address.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/setup-1.avif" />
    </Frame>

    Access may be restricted to specific IPs if required — see [IP Filtering](/installation/database-setup/security-and-ip-filtering).

    ### 1. Enable Logical Replication

    Set the `rds.logical_replication` parameter to `1` in the parameter group for the instance.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/setup-2.png" />
    </Frame>

    ### 2. Create a PowerSync Database User

    Create a PowerSync user on Postgres:

    ```sql
    -- SQL to create powersync user
    CREATE ROLE powersync_role WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'myhighlyrandompassword';

    -- Allow the role to perform replication tasks
    GRANT rds_replication TO powersync_role;

    -- Set up permissions for the newly created role
    -- Read-only (SELECT) access is required
    GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO powersync_role;
    ```

    To restrict read access to specific tables, explicitly list allowed tables for both the `SELECT` privilege, and for the publication (as well as for any other publications that may exist).

    ### 3. Create "powersync" Publication

    <PostgresPowerSyncPublication />
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Azure Postgres">
    PowerSync supports both "Azure Database for PostgreSQL" and "Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server".

    ### Prerequisites

    The database must be accessible on the public internet. Once you have created your database, navigate to Settings -> Networking and enable **Public access.**

    ### 1. Enable Logical Replication

    Follow the steps as noted in this article to allow logical replication:

    [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/concepts-logical#prerequisites-for-logical-replication-and-logical-decoding](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/concepts-logical#prerequisites-for-logical-replication-and-logical-decoding)

    ### 2. Create a PowerSync Database User

    <PostgresPowerSyncUser />

    ### 3. Create "powersync" Publication

    <PostgresPowerSyncPublication />
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Google Cloud SQL">
    ### 1. Enable Logical Replication

    In Google Cloud SQL Postgres, enabling the logical replication is done using flags:

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/setup-3.png" />
    </Frame>

    ### 2. Create a PowerSync Database User

    <PostgresPowerSyncUser />

    ### 3. Create "powersync" Publication

    <PostgresPowerSyncPublication />
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Neon">
    Neon is a serverless Postgres environment with an innovative pricing model that separates storage and compute.

    ### 1. Enable Logical Replication

    Open your project and navigate to "**Settings**" -> "**Beta**", then click "**Enable**".

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/setup-4.avif" />
    </Frame>

    ### 2. Create a PowerSync Database User

    <PostgresPowerSyncUser />

    ### 3. Create "powersync" Publication

    <PostgresPowerSyncPublication />
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Fly Postgres">
    Fly Postgres is a [Fly](https://fly.io/) app with [flyctl](https://fly.io/docs/flyctl/) sugar on top to help you bootstrap and manage a database cluster for your apps.

    ### 1. Enable Logical Replication

    Once you've deployed your Fly Postgres cluster, it's time to enable logical replication.

    This is performed by running the below command:

    ```bash
    fly pg config update --wal-level=logical
    ```

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/setup-5.avif" />
    </Frame>

    ### 2. Create a PowerSync Database User

    <PostgresPowerSyncUser />

    ### 3. Create "powersync" Publication

    <PostgresPowerSyncPublication />
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

  ### 1. Enable Logical Replication

  PowerSync reads the Postgres WAL using logical replication in order to create sync buckets in accordance with the specified PowerSync [Sync Rules](/usage/sync-rules).

  If you are managing Postgres yourself, set `wal_level = logical` in your config file:

  <Frame>
    <img src="/images/setup-6.avif" />
  </Frame>

  Alternatively, you can use the below SQL commands to check and enable logical replication:

  ```sql
  -- Check the replication type

  SHOW wal_level;

  -- Enable logical replication

  ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_level = logical;
  ```

  Note that Postgres must be restarted after changing this config.

  If you're using a managed Postgres service, there may be a setting for this in the relevant section of the service's admin console.

  ### 2. Create a PowerSync Database User

  <PostgresPowerSyncUser />

  ### 3. Create "powersync" Publication

  <PostgresPowerSyncPublication />
</Accordion>

### Unsupported Hosted Postgres Providers

Due to the logical replication requirement, not all hosting providers are supported.

Notably, some "serverless Postgres" providers do not support logical replication, and are therefore not supported by PowerSync yet.

## <Icon icon="leaf" iconType="solid" size="24" /> MongoDB

<Check>
  **Version compatibility**: PowerSync requires MongoDB version 6.0 or greater.
</Check>

### Permissions required - MongoDB Atlas

For MongoDB Atlas databases, the minimum permissions are:

```
readWrite@<your_database>._powersync_checkpoints
read@<your_database>
```

To allow PowerSync to automatically enable [`changeStreamPreAndPostImages`](#post-images) on
replicated collections, additionally add the `dbAdmin` permission:

```
readWrite@<your_database>._powersync_checkpoints
read@<your_database>
dbAdmin@<your_database>
```

If you are replicating from multiple databases in the cluster, you need read permissions on the entire cluster, in addition to the above:

```
readAnyDatabase@admin
```

### Privileges required - Self-hosted / Custom roles

For self-hosted MongoDB, or for creating custom roles on MongoDB Atlas, PowerSync requires the following privileges/granted actions:

* On the database being replicated: `listCollections`.
* On all collections in the database: `changeStream`.
   * This must apply to the entire database, not individual collections, `collection: ""`.
   * If replicating from multiple databases, this must apply to the entire cluster, `db: ""`.
* On each collection being replicated: `find`.
* On the `_powersync_checkpoints` collection: `createCollection`, `dropCollection`, `find`, `changeStream`, `insert`, `update`, and `remove`.
* To allow PowerSync to automatically enable [`changeStreamPreAndPostImages`](#post-images) on
replicated collections, additionally add the `collMod` permission on all replicated collections.


### Post-Images

To replicate data from MongoDB to PowerSync in a consistent manner, PowerSync
uses Change Streams with [post-images](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v6.0/reference/command/collMod/#change-streams-with-document-pre--and-post-images) to get the complete document after each change.
This requires the `changeStreamPreAndPostImages` option to be enabled on replicated collections.

PowerSync supports three configuration options for post-images:

1. `post_images: off`: Uses `fullDocument: 'updateLookup'` for backwards compatibility. This was the default for older instances. However, this may lead to consistency issues, so we strongly recommend enabling post-images instead.

2. `post_images: auto_configure` (Default for new instances): Automatically enables the `changeStreamPreAndPostImages` option on collections as needed. Requires the permissions/privileges mentioned above. If a collection is removed from Sync Rules, developers can manually disable `changeStreamPreAndPostImages`.

3. `post_images: read_only`: Uses `fullDocument: 'required'` and requires `changeStreamPreAndPostImages: { enabled: true }` to be set on every collection referenced in Sync Rules. Replication will error if this is not configured. This option is ideal when permissions are restricted.

To manually configure collections for `read_only` mode, run this on each collection:

```js
db.runCommand( {
 collMod: <collection>,
 changeStreamPreAndPostImages: { enabled: <boolean> }
} )
```

You can view which collections have the option enabled using:

```js
db.getCollectionInfos().filter(c => c.options?.changeStreamPreAndPostImages?.enabled)
```

Post-images can be configured for PowerSync Cloud instances under the connection settings in the Dashboard (right-click on your instance to edit it). For self-hosted PowerSync instances, configure post-images in the `config.yaml` file; see an example [here](https://github.com/powersync-ja/self-host-demo/blob/main/demos/nodejs-mongodb/config/powersync.yaml).

## <Icon icon="dolphin" iconType="solid" size="24" /> MySQL (Alpha)

<Info>
  This section is a work in progress. More details for MySQL connections are coming soon. In the meantime, ask on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/powersync) if you have any questions.
</Info>

<Check>
  **Version compatibility**: PowerSync requires MySQL version 5.7 or greater.
</Check>

MySQL connections use the [binary log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/binary-log.html) to replicate changes.

Generally, this requires the following config:

* `gtid_mode` : `ON`

* `enforce_gtid_consistency` : `ON`

* `binlog_format` : `ROW`

PowerSync also requires a user with replication permissions on the database. An example:

```sql
-- Create a user with necessary privileges
CREATE USER 'repl_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'good_password';

-- Grant replication client privilege
GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE, REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'repl_user'@'%';

-- Grant access to the specific database
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON powersync.* TO 'repl_user'@'%';

-- Apply changes
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```
