- [**Flutter**](/client-sdk-references/flutter) (mobile and [web](/client-sdk-references/flutter/flutter-web-support)) 
- [**React Native**](/client-sdk-references/react-native-and-expo) (mobile and [web](/client-sdk-references/react-native-and-expo/react-native-web-support)) 
- [**JavaScript Web**](/client-sdk-references/javascript-web) (vanilla JS, React, Vue) 
- [**Node.js**](/client-sdk-references/node) (alpha)
- [**Kotlin Multiplatform**](/client-sdk-references/kotlin-multiplatform)
- [**Swift**](/client-sdk-references/swift)

## Implementation outline

The following outlines our recommended steps to implement PowerSync in your project:

<Steps>
  <Step title="[Optional] Create a PowerSync Cloud account">
    Sign up for a free PowerSync Cloud account [here](https://accounts.journeyapps.com/portal/powersync-signup?s=docs) if you want to go ahead with our cloud-hosted option. PowerSync can also be self-hosted — see instructions in step 3.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your Source Database">
    Configure your source database for PowerSync — see [Source Database Setup](/installation/database-setup).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect PowerSync to your Database">
    Connect your database to your instance of the PowerSync Service:
      1. Using PowerSync Cloud: See [Database Connection](/installation/database-connection)
      2. Using PowerSync Open Edition (self-hosted): Refer to our [self-hosting section](/self-hosting/getting-started) for configuration details and examples.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Basic Sync Rules">
    Define [Sync Rules](/usage/sync-rules) in PowerSync — this enables dynamic partial replication so that you don't need to sync your entire database to devices.
    - Learn about Sync Rules in our introductory [blog post](https://www.powersync.com/blog/sync-rules-from-first-principles-partial-replication-to-sqlite).
    - We recommend starting with one or two simple [Global Data](/usage/sync-rules/example-global-data) queries.
  </Step>
  <Step title="[Optional] Generate a Development Token">
    Generate a [Development Token](/installation/authentication-setup/development-tokens) so you can get up and running quickly, without implementing full custom authentication.
  </Step>
  <Step title="[Optional] Test Sync with our Diagnostics App">
    Use our hosted [Diagnostics App](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-js/tree/main/tools/diagnostics-app) to validate that your source database is syncing into SQLite as expected.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implement PowerSync on the Client-Side">
    Implement an app using one of our Client SDKs:
   1. To start, you can continue using your Development Token.
   2. Implement a "Hello World" app to quickly get a feel, **or** jump straight into installing the client SDK in your existing app — see [Client-Side Setup](/installation/client-side-setup) or follow end-to-end getting started instructions in the [full SDK reference](/client-sdk-references/introduction).
   3. Verify that downloads from your source database are working. Data should reflect in your UI and you can also [inspect the SQLite database](/resources/troubleshooting#inspect-local-sqlite-database).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implement Authentication">
   Implement authentication for clients (JWT-based) — see our [docs here](/installation/authentication-setup).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your App Backend">
   Implement your [backend app](/installation/app-backend-setup) to accept and process writes from clients.
    - We have Node.js, Django and Rails demos available [here](/resources/demo-apps-example-projects#custom-backend-examples).
  </Step>
