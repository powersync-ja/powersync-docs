title: "Development Tokens"
---

PowerSync allows generating temporary development tokens for authentication. This is useful for developers who want to get up and running quickly, without a full custom auth implementation. This may also be used to generate a token for a specific user to debug issues.

## Generating a Development Token:

### PowerSync Cloud - Dashboard:

1. **Enable setting**: The "Enable development tokens" setting must be set on the PowerSync instance. This should be enabled by default for new instances. It can be set in the instance's config (In the [PowerSync dashboard](https://powersync.journeyapps.com/): Edit instance -> _Client Auth_).

1. **Generate token**: Call the "Generate development token" action for your instance. In the [PowerSync dashboard](https://powersync.journeyapps.com/), this can be done via the command palette (CMD+SHIFT+P / SHIFT+SHIFT), or by selecting it from an instance's options (right-click on an instance for options).

1. Enter token subject / user ID: This is the ID of the user you want to authenticate and is used in [sync rules](/usage/sync-rules) as `request.user_id()` (previously, `token_parameters.user_id`)

1. Copy the generated token. Note that these tokens expire after 12 hours.

### Self-hosted Setup / Local Development

For self-hosted [local development](/self-hosting/local-development), the [powersync-service test client](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-service/tree/main/test-client) contains a script to generate a development token, given a .yaml config file with an HS256 key. Run the following command:

```bash
node dist/bin.js generate-token --config path/to/powersync.yaml --sub test-user
```

For more information on generating development tokens, see the [Generate development tokens tutorial](/tutorials/self-host/generate-dev-token)

## Usage

To use the temporary development token, update the `fetchCredentials()` function in your backend connector to return the generated token (see [Integrate with your Backend](/installation/client-side-setup/integrating-with-your-backend) for more information).

Example:

```js
return PowerSyncCredentials(
        endpoint: AppConfig.powersyncUrl,
        token: 'temp-token-here');
```
