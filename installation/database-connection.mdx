## Create a PowerSync Instance

## Specify Connection Details

Each database provider has their quirks when it comes to specifying connection details, so we have documented database-specific and provider-specific instructions below:

## <Icon icon="elephant" iconType="solid" size={32}/> Postgres Provider Specifics

Select your Postgres hosting provider for steps to connect your newly-created PowerSync instance to your Postgres database:
<AccordionGroup>
   <Accordion title="Supabase">
   <SupabaseConnection/>

   ### Troubleshooting

   Supabase is configured with a maximum of 4 logical replication slots, with one often used for Supabase Realtime.

   It is therefore easy to run out of replication slots, resulting in an error such as "All replication slots are in use" when deploying. To resolve this, delete inactive replication slots by running this query:

   ```sql
   select slot_name, pg_drop_replication_slot(slot_name) from pg_replication_slots where active = false;
   ```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="AWS RDS">
1. [Locate the connection details from RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ConnectToPostgreSQLInstance.html):
   * Copy the **"Endpoint"** value.
   * Paste the endpoint into the "**Host**" field.
   * Complete the remaining fields: "**Name**", "**Host**", "**Port**", "**Database name**", "**Username**", "**Password**" and "**SSL Mode"** are required. You can paste a connection string into the "**URI**" field to simplify this.
   * "**Name**" can be any name for the connection.
   * "**Port**" is 5432 for Postgres databases.
   * "**Username**" and "**Password**" maps to the `powersync_role` created in [Source Database Setup](/installation/database-setup).
   * PowerSync has the AWS RDS CA certificate pre-configured — `verify-full` SSL mode can be used directly, without any additional configuration required.
   * If you want to query your source database via the PowerSync Dashboard, enable "**Allow querying data from the dashboard?**".
2. Click **"Test Connection"** and fix any errors.
3. Click **"Save".**

PowerSync deploys and configures an isolated cloud environment for you, which can take a few minutes to complete.

### Troubleshooting

If you get an error such as "IPs in this range are not supported", the instance is likely not configured to be publicly accessible. A DNS lookup on the host should give a public IP, and not for example `10.x.x.x` or `172.31.x.x`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Azure Postgres">
1. Fill in your connection details from Azure.
   1. "**Name**", "**Host**", "**Port**", "**Database name**", "**Username**", "**Password**" and "**SSL Mode"** are required. You can also paste a connection string into the "**URI**" field to simplify data entry.
   2. "**Name**" can be any name for the connection.
   3. "**Port**" is 5432 for Postgres databases.
   4. "**Username**" and "**Password**" maps to the `powersync_role` created in [Source Database Setup](/installation/database-setup).
   5. PowerSync has the Azure CA certificate pre-configured — `verify-full` SSL mode can be used directly, without any additional configuration required.
   6. If you want to query your source database via the PowerSync Dashboard, enable "**Allow querying data from the dashboard?**".
2. Click **"Test Connection"** and fix any errors.
   * If you encounter the error `"must be superuser or replication role to start walsender"`, ensure that you've followed all the steps for enabling logical replication documented [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/concepts-logical#prerequisites-for-logical-replication-and-logical-decoding).
3. Click **"Save".**

<Accordion title="Google Cloud SQL">
1. Fill in your connection details from Google Cloud SQL.
   * "**Name**", "**Host**", "**Port**", "**Database name**", "**Username**", "**Password**" and "**SSL Mode"** are required. You can paste a connection string into the "**URI**" field to simplify data entry.
   * "**Name**" can be any name for the connection.
   * "**Port**" is 5432 for Postgres databases.
   * "**Username**" and "**Password**" maps to the `powersync_role` created in [Source Database Setup](/installation/database-setup).
   * The server certificate can be downloaded from Google Cloud SQL.
   * If SSL is enforced, a client certificate and key must also be created on Google Cloud SQL, and configured on the PowerSync instance.
   * If you want to query your source database via the PowerSync Dashboard, enable "**Allow querying data from the dashboard?**".
2. Click **"Test Connection"** and fix any errors.

## <Icon icon="leaf" iconType="solid" size={32}/> MongoDB Specifics

1. Fill in your connection details from MongoDB:
   1. Copy your cluster's connection string and paste it into the PowerSync instance **URI** field. PowerSync will automatically parse this URI to populate other connection details.
      - The format should be `mongodb+srv://[username:password@]host/[database]`. For example, `mongodb+srv://admin:<db_password>@cluster0.abcde1.mongodb.net/powersync`
   2. Enter your database user's password into the **Password** field. See the necessary permissions in [Source Database Setup](/installation/database-setup#mongodb).
   3. "**Database name**" is the database in your cluster to replicate.
2. Click **"Test Connection"** and fix any errors. If have any issues connecting, reach out to our support engineers on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/powersync) or otherwise [contact us](/resources/contact-us).
   1. Make sure that your database allows access to PowerSync's IPs — see [Security and IP Filtering](/installation/database-setup/security-and-ip-filtering)
3. Click **"Save"**.

## <Icon icon="dolphin" iconType="solid" size={32}/> MySQL (Beta) Specifics

Select your MySQL hosting provider for steps to connect your newly-created PowerSync instance to your MySQL database:
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="AWS Aurora">
To enable binary logging and GTID replication in AWS Aurora, you need to create a [DB Parameter Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraMySQL.Reference.ParameterGroups.html)
and configure it with the necessary parameters. Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to [Amazon RDS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/)
   In the navigation pane, choose Parameter groups and click on `Create Parameter Group`.
   <Frame>
       <img src="/images/installation/aurora-create-parameter-group.png" />
   </Frame>
2. Add all the required [binlog configuration](/installation/database-setup#binlog-configuration) parameters. For example:
   <Frame>
       <img src="/images/installation/aurora-set-gtid-flags.png" />
   </Frame>
3. Associate your newly created parameter group with your Aurora cluster:
   1. In the navigation pane, choose Databases.
   2. Select your Aurora cluster.
   3. Choose Modify.
   4. In the DB Parameter Group section, select the parameter group you created.
   5. Click Continue and then Apply immediately.
4. Whitelist PowerSync's IPs in your Aurora cluster's security group to allow access. See [Security and IP Filtering](/installation/database-setup/security-and-ip-filtering) for more details.
