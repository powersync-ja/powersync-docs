### Sign Up for PowerSync Cloud

The easiest way to get started with PowerSync is to use [PowerSync Cloud](https://www.powersync.com/pricing), our hosted offering.

If you have not yet signed up for PowerSync Cloud, [you can do so here](https://accounts.journeyapps.com/portal/get-started?powersync=true&s=docs-quickstart). You can get started with our [Free plan](https://www.powersync.co/pricing).

### Supported Backend Databases

PowerSync currently works with the following backend databases:

<Accordion title="Postgres / PostgreSQL" icon="elephant">
  PowerSync works with any [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) database that supports logical replication.

  * PowerSync has prebuilt functionality (e.g. [auth integration](/usage/installation/authentication-setup/supabase-auth)) to make it easy to use with [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), a backend-as-a-service based on Postgres. This is a great way to get started with PowerSync and Postgres. See our [Supabase integration guide here](/integration-guides/supabase-+-powersync).
  * If you are not using Supabase, please follow the [steps here for source database setup](/usage/installation/database-setup), which includes details on other hosted Postgres providers such as AWS RDS, Azure, Google (GCP), Fly, Neon, etc.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="MongoDB (alpha)" icon="leaf">
  PowerSync supports MongoDB databases, including MongoDB Atlas and self-managed MongoDB.

  Refer to [Source Database Setup](/usage/installation/database-setup) and [Database Connection](/usage/installation/database-connection) for setup details.

  For developers migrating from MongoDB Atlas Device Sync to PowerSync, see our [migration guide](/migration-guides/mongodb-atlas).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="MySQL (alpha)" icon="dolphin">
  PowerSync supports MySQL backend databases (currently in an alpha release).

  Refer to [Source Database Setup](/usage/installation/database-setup) and [Database Connection](/usage/installation/database-connection) for setup details.
