## Our Approach to ORM Support

As much as some developers love to drop into raw SQL for advanced queries, it can be annoying to have to write SQL for simple queries, often because there’s no type-safety. Using an ORM helps address this challenge.

With PowerSync our philosophy is to not force a specific ORM on developers. Instead, we decided to allow any approach from raw SQL queries to working with popular ORM libraries.

We specifically avoid implementing our own ORM since we feel it's better to support popular existing ORMs, which likely do a much better job than we can. It also makes it easier to switch to/from PowerSync if you can keep most of your database code the same.
