On Auth0, create a new API:

* **Name**: PowerSync
* **Identifier**: PowerSync instance URL, e.g. `https://{instance}.powersync.journeyapps.com`

On the PowerSync instance, add the Auth0 JWKS URI: `https://{auth0-domain}/.well-known/jwks.json`

In the application, generate access tokens with the PowerSync instance URL as the audience, and use this to connect to PowerSync.
