This refers to the <Tooltip tip="The client-side schema is typically mainly derived from your backend database schema and Sync Rules, but can also include other tables such as local-only tables.">schema</Tooltip> for the managed SQLite database exposed by the PowerSync Client SDKs, that your app can read from and write to. The schema is applied when the database is instantiated (as we'll show in the next step) — no <Tooltip tip="Schema migrations are not required on the SQLite database due to the schemaless nature of the PowerSync protocol. Schemaless data is synced to the client-side SQLite database, and the schema is then applied to that data using SQLite views to allow for structured querying of the data. The exception to this is if you are using Raw Tables (see Advanced section of Client SDK docs)">migrations</Tooltip> are required.
