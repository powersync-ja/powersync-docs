title: "Development Tokens"
---

PowerSync allows generating temporary development tokens for authentication. This is useful for developers who want to get up and running quickly, without a full custom auth implementation. This may also be used to generate a token for a specific user to debug issues.

## Generating a Development Token:

### PowerSync Cloud - Dashboard:

1. **Enable setting**: The "Enable development tokens" setting must be set on the PowerSync instance. In the [PowerSync Dashboard](https://dashboard.powersync.com/), select your project and instance, go to the **Client Auth** view, and enable the "Enable development tokens" setting.
2. Next, click the **Connect** button in the top bar, and follow the instructions to generate a development token.
3. Enter the token subject / user ID: This is the ID of the user you want to authenticate and is used in [Sync Rules](/usage/sync-rules) as `request.user_id()`.
4. Click **Generate Token**. Copy the generated token. Note that these tokens expire after 12 hours.

### Self-hosted Setup / Local Development

For self-hosted [local development](/self-hosting/local-development), the [powersync-service test client](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-service/tree/main/test-client) contains a script to generate a development token, given a .yaml config file with an HS256 key. Run the following command:

```bash
node dist/bin.js generate-token --config path/to/powersync.yaml --sub test-user
```

For more information on generating development tokens, see the [Generate development tokens tutorial](/tutorials/self-host/generate-dev-token)

## Usage

To use the temporary development token, update the `fetchCredentials()` function in your backend connector to return the generated token (see [Integrate with your Backend](/installation/client-side-setup/integrating-with-your-backend) for more information).

Example:

```js
return PowerSyncCredentials(
        endpoint: AppConfig.powersyncUrl,
        token: 'temp-token-here');
```
