PowerSync is designed to be stack agnostic, and currently supports **Postgres**, **MongoDB** (alpha) and **MySQL** (alpha) as the source database, and has official SDKs for [**Flutter**](/client-sdk-references/flutter) (mobile and [web](/client-sdk-references/flutter/flutter-web-support)), [**React Native**](/client-sdk-references/react-native-and-expo) (mobile and [web](/client-sdk-references/react-native-and-expo/react-native-web-support)), [**JavaScript/Web**](/client-sdk-references/javascript-web) (vanilla JS, React, Vue), [**Kotlin Multiplatform**](/client-sdk-references/kotlin-multiplatform) (beta) and [**Swift**](/client-sdk-references/swift) (alpha) available on the client-side today.

<Note>
Support for additional platforms is on our [Roadmap](https://roadmap.powersync.com/). If one isn't supported today, please add your vote and check back soon.

If you are using [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) as your backend, we provide a [PowerSync\<>Supabase integration guide](/integration-guides/supabase-+-powersync) which incudes a tutorial and example app to quickly learn how to use PowerSync with Supabase.

## Implementation outline

The following outlines our recommended steps to implement PowerSync in your project:

<Steps>
  <Step title="[Optional] Create a PowerSync Cloud account">
    Sign up for a free PowerSync Cloud account [here](https://accounts.journeyapps.com/portal/get-started?powersync=true&s=docs-quickstart) if you want to go ahead with our cloud-hosted option. PowerSync can also be self-hosted - see instructions in the next step.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your Source Database">
    Configure your source database for PowerSync - see [Source Database Setup](/installation/database-setup).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect PowerSync to your Database">
    Connect your database to your instance of the PowerSync Service:
      1. Using PowerSync Cloud: See [Database Connection](/installation/database-connection)
      2. Using PowerSync Open Edition (self-hosted): Refer to our [self-hosting section](/self-hosting/getting-started) for configuration details and examples.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Basic Sync Rules">
    Define [Sync Rules](/usage/sync-rules) in PowerSync â€” this enables dynamic partial replication so that you don't need to sync your entire database to devices.
    - Learn about Sync Rules in our introductory [Blog post](https://www.powersync.com/blog/sync-rules-from-first-principles-partial-replication-to-sqlite).
    - We recommend starting with one or two simple [Global Data](/usage/sync-rules/example-global-data) queries.
  </Step>
  <Step title="[Optional] Generate a Development Token">
    Generate a [Development Token](/installation/authentication-setup/development-tokens) so you can get up and running quickly, without implementing full custom auth.
  </Step>
  <Step title="[Optional] Test Sync with our Diagnostics App">
    Use our hosted [Diagnostics App](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-js/tree/main/tools/diagnostics-app) to validate that your source database is syncing into SQLite as expected.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implement an app using one of our Client SDKs">
    Implement an app using one of our [Client SDKs](https://docs.powersync.com/client-sdk-references/introduction)
   1. You can continue using your Development Token for a start
   2. Implement a "Hello World" app to get a feel, **or** jump straight into pulling the Client SDK into your existing app.
   3. Verify that downloads from your source database are working. Data should reflect in your UI and you can also [inspect the SQLite database](/resources/troubleshooting#inspect-local-sqlite-database).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implement Authentication">
   Implement authentication for clients (JWT-based) - see our [docs here](/installation/authentication-setup).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your App Backend">
   Implement your [backend app](/installation/app-backend-setup) to accept and process writes from clients.
    - We have Node.js, Django and Rails demos available [here](/resources/demo-apps-example-projects#custom-backend-examples).
