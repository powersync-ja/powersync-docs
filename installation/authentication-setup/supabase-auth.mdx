You can implement various types of auth:

* Standard [Supabase Auth](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth)
   * JavaScript [example](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-js/blob/58fd05937ec9ac993622666742f53200ee694585/demos/react-supabase-todolist/src/library/powersync/SupabaseConnector.ts#L87)
   * Dart/Flutter [example](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync.dart/blob/9ef224175c8969f5602c140bcec6dd8296c31260/demos/supabase-todolist/lib/powersync.dart#L38)
   * Kotlin [example](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-kotlin/blob/4f60e2089745dda21b0d486c70f47adbbe24d289/connectors/supabase/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/powersync/connector/supabase/SupabaseConnector.kt#L75)
* Anonymous Sign-Ins
   * JavaScript [Example](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-js/blob/58fd05937ec9ac993622666742f53200ee694585/demos/react-multi-client/src/library/SupabaseConnector.ts#L47)
* Fully custom auth
   * [Example](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-jwks-example/)
* Experimental: We've also heard from the community that Supabase's newly released [support for external auth providers works](https://supabase.com/blog/third-party-auth-mfa-phone-send-hooks), but we don't have any examples for this yet.

To implement either Supabase Auth or Anonymous Sign-Ins, enable the "Use Supabase Auth" setting on the PowerSync instance. (This is also [covered in the Supabase & PowerSync integration guide](/integration-guides/supabase-+-powersync#configuring-powersync))

Internally, Supabase auth signs the token using HS256, using a secret available as `current_setting('app.settings.jwt_secret')` on the database.

To rotate the secret, generate a new secret in the Supabase project settings. The new secret will be automatically picked up by PowerSync within 5 minutes. In this period, some authentication failures are expected.

The Supabase user UUID will be available as `token_parameters.user_id`. To use a different identifier as the user ID in sync rules (for example user email), use [Custom authentication](/installation/authentication-setup/custom).
