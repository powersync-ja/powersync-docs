## Getting Started

Before implementing the PowerSync SDK in your project, make sure you have completed these steps:

* Signed up for a PowerSync Cloud account ([here](https://accounts.journeyapps.com/portal/powersync-signup?s=docs)) or [self-host PowerSync](/self-hosting/getting-started).
* [Configured your backend database](/installation/database-setup) and connected it to your PowerSync instance.
* [Installed](/client-sdk-references/flutter#installation) the PowerSync Flutter SDK.

<Note>
For this reference document, we assume that you have created a Flutter project and have the following directory structure:

```plaintext
lib/
├── models/
    ├── schema.dart
    └── todolist.dart
├── powersync/
    ├── my_backend_connector.dart
    └── powersync.dart
├── widgets/
    ├── lists_widget.dart
    ├── todos_widget.dart
├── main.dart
```
</Note>

### 1\. Define the Schema

The first step is defining the schema for the local SQLite database. This will be provided as a `schema` parameter to the [PowerSyncDatabase](https://pub.dev/documentation/powersync/latest/powersync/PowerSyncDatabase/PowerSyncDatabase.html) constructor.

This schema represents a "view" of the downloaded data. No migrations are required — the schema is applied directly when the PowerSync database is constructed.

<Info>
**Generate schema automatically**

In the [dashboard](/usage/tools/powersync-dashboard), the schema can be generated based off your sync rules by right-clicking on an instance and selecting **Generate client-side schema**.

Similar functionality exists in the [CLI](/usage/tools/cli).

</Info>
The types available are `text`, `integer` and `real`. These should map directly to the values produced by the [Sync Rules](/usage/sync-rules). If a value doesn't match, it is cast automatically. For details on how Postgres types are mapped to the types below, see the section on [Types](/usage/sync-rules/types) in the _Sync Rules_ documentation.

**Example**:

```dart lib/models/schema.dart
import 'package:powersync/powersync.dart';

const schema = Schema(([
  Table('todos', [
    Column.text('list_id'),
    Column.text('created_at'),
    Column.text('completed_at'),
    Column.text('description'),
    Column.integer('completed'),
    Column.text('created_by'),
    Column.text('completed_by'),
  ], indexes: [
    // Index to allow efficient lookup within a list
    Index('list', [IndexedColumn('list_id')])
  ]),
  Table('lists', [
    Column.text('created_at'),
    Column.text('name'),
    Column.text('owner_id')
  ])
]));
```

<Info>
  **Note**: No need to declare a primary key `id` column, as PowerSync will automatically create this.
</Info>

### 2\. Instantiate the PowerSync Database

Next, you need to instantiate the PowerSync database — this is the core managed client-side database.

Its primary functions are to record all changes in the local database, whether online or offline. In addition, it automatically uploads changes to your app backend when connected.

To instantiate `PowerSyncDatabase`, inject the Schema you defined in the previous step and a file path — it's important to only instantiate one instance of `PowerSyncDatabase` per file.

**Example**:

```dart lib/powersync/powersync.dart
import 'package:path/path.dart';
import 'package:path_provider/path_provider.dart';
import 'package:powersync/powersync.dart';
import '../main.dart';
import '../models/schema.dart';

openDatabase() async {
  final dir = await getApplicationSupportDirectory();
  final path = join(dir.path, 'powersync-dart.db');

  // Set up the database
  // Inject the Schema you defined in the previous step and a file path
  db = PowerSyncDatabase(schema: schema, path: path);
  await db.initialize();
}
```

Once you've instantiated your PowerSync database, you will need to call the [connect()](https://pub.dev/documentation/powersync/latest/powersync/PowerSyncDatabase/connect.html) method to activate it. This method requires the backend connector that will be created in the next step.

```dart lib/main.dart {35}
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:powersync/powersync.dart';

import 'powersync/powersync.dart';

late PowerSyncDatabase db;

Future<void> main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  await openDatabase();
  runApp(const DemoApp());
}

class DemoApp extends StatefulWidget {
  const DemoApp({super.key});

  @override
  State<DemoApp> createState() => _DemoAppState();
}

class _DemoAppState extends State<DemoApp> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
        title: 'Demo',
        home: // TODO: Implement your own UI here.
        // You could listen for authentication state changes to connect or disconnect from PowerSync
        StreamBuilder(
            stream: // TODO: some stream,
            builder: (ctx, snapshot) {,
              // TODO: implement your own condition here
              if ( ... ) {
                // Uses the backend connector that will be created in the next step
                db.connect(connector: MyBackendConnector());
                // TODO: implement your own UI here
              }
            },
        )
    );
  }
}
```

### 3\. Integrate with your Backend

The PowerSync backend connector provides the connection between your application backend and the PowerSync client-slide managed SQLite database.

It is used to:

1. [Retrieve an auth token](/installation/authentication-setup) to connect to the PowerSync instance.
2. [Apply local changes](/installation/app-backend-setup/writing-client-changes) on your backend application server (and from there, to your backend database)

Accordingly, the connector must implement two methods:

1. [PowerSyncBackendConnector.fetchCredentials](https://pub.dev/documentation/powersync/latest/powersync/PowerSyncBackendConnector/fetchCredentials.html) \- This is called every couple of minutes and is used to obtain credentials for your app backend API. -> See [Authentication Setup](/installation/authentication-setup) for instructions on how the credentials should be generated.
2. [PowerSyncBackendConnector.uploadData](https://pub.dev/documentation/powersync/latest/powersync/PowerSyncBackendConnector/uploadData.html) \- Use this to upload client-side changes to your app backend.
\-> See [Writing Client Changes](/installation/app-backend-setup/writing-client-changes) for considerations on the app backend implementation.

**Example**:

```dart lib/powersync/my_backend_connector.dart
import 'package:powersync/powersync.dart';

class MyBackendConnector extends PowerSyncBackendConnector {
  PowerSyncDatabase db;

  MyBackendConnector(this.db);
  @override
  Future<PowerSyncCredentials?> fetchCredentials() async {
    // Implement fetchCredentials to obtain a JWT from your authentication service
    // If you're using Supabase or Firebase, you can re-use the JWT from those clients, see
    // - https://docs.powersync.com/installation/authentication-setup/supabase-auth
    // - https://docs.powersync.com/installation/authentication-setup/firebase-auth

    // See example implementation here: https://pub.dev/documentation/powersync/latest/powersync/DevConnector/fetchCredentials.html

    return PowerSyncCredentials(
      endpoint: 'https://xxxxxx.powersync.journeyapps.com',
      // Use a development token (see Authentication Setup https://docs.powersync.com/installation/authentication-setup/development-tokens) to get up and running quickly
      token: 'An authentication token'
    );
  }

  // Implement uploadData to send local changes to your backend service
  // You can omit this method if you only want to sync data from the server to the client
  // See example implementation here: https://docs.powersync.com/client-sdk-references/flutter#3-integrate-with-your-backend
  @override
  Future<void> uploadData(PowerSyncDatabase database) async {
    // This function is called whenever there is data to upload, whether the
    // device is online or offline.
    // If this call throws an error, it is retried periodically.

    final transaction = await database.getNextCrudTransaction();
    if (transaction == null) {
      return;
    }

    // The data that needs to be changed in the remote db
    for (var op in transaction.crud) {
      switch (op.op) {
        case UpdateType.put:
          // TODO: Instruct your backend API to CREATE a record
        case UpdateType.patch:
          // TODO: Instruct your backend API to PATCH a record
        case UpdateType.delete:
        //TODO: Instruct your backend API to DELETE a record
      }
    }

    // Completes the transaction and moves onto the next one
    await transaction.complete();
  }
}

```

## Using PowerSync: CRUD functions

Once the PowerSync instance is configured you can start using the SQLite DB functions.

The most commonly used CRUD functions to interact with your SQLite data are:

* [PowerSyncDatabase.get](/client-sdk-references/flutter#fetching-a-single-item) \- get (SELECT) a single row from a table.
* [PowerSyncDatabase.getAll](/client-sdk-references/flutter#querying-items-powersync.getall) \- get (SELECT) a set of rows from a table.
* [PowerSyncDatabase.watch](/client-sdk-references/flutter#watching-queries-powersync.watch) \- execute a read query every time source tables are modified.
* [PowerSyncDatabase.execute](/client-sdk-references/flutter#mutations-powersync.execute) \- execute a write (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) query.

For the following examples, we will define a `TodoList` model class that represents a List of todos.

```dart lib/models/todolist.dart
/// This is a simple model class representing a TodoList
class TodoList {
  final int id;
  final String name;
  final DateTime createdAt;
  final DateTime updatedAt;

  TodoList({
    required this.id,
    required this.name,
    required this.createdAt,
    required this.updatedAt,
  });

  factory TodoList.fromRow(Map<String, dynamic> row) {
    return TodoList(
      id: row['id'],
      name: row['name'],
      createdAt: DateTime.parse(row['created_at']),
      updatedAt: DateTime.parse(row['updated_at']),
    );
  }
}
```

### Fetching a Single Item

The [get](https://pub.dev/documentation/powersync/latest/sqlite_async/SqliteQueries/get.html) method executes a read-only (SELECT) query and returns a single result. It throws an exception if no result is found. Use [getOptional](https://pub.dev/documentation/powersync/latest/sqlite_async/SqliteQueries/getOptional.html) to return a single optional result (returns `null` if no result is found).

The following is an example of selecting a list item by ID
```dart lib/widgets/lists_widget.dart
import '../main.dart';
import '../models/todolist.dart';

Future<TodoList> find(id) async {
  final result = await db.get('SELECT * FROM lists WHERE id = ?', [id]);
  return TodoList.fromRow(result);
}
```

### Querying Items (PowerSync.getAll)

The [getAll](https://pub.dev/documentation/powersync/latest/sqlite_async/SqliteQueries/getAll.html) method returns a set of rows from a table.

```dart lib/widgets/lists_widget.dart
import 'package:powersync/sqlite3.dart';
import '../main.dart';

Future<List<String>> getLists() async {
  ResultSet results = await db.getAll('SELECT id FROM lists WHERE id IS NOT NULL');
  List<String> ids = results.map((row) => row['id'] as String).toList();
  return ids;
}
```

### Watching Queries (PowerSync.watch)

The [watch](https://pub.dev/documentation/powersync/latest/sqlite_async/SqliteQueries/watch.html) method executes a read query whenever a change to a dependent table is made.

<FlutterWatch />

### Mutations (PowerSync.execute)

The [execute](https://pub.dev/documentation/powersync/latest/powersync/PowerSyncDatabase/execute.html) method can be used for executing single SQLite write statements.

```dart lib/widgets/todos_widget.dart {12-15}
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import '../main.dart';

// Example Todos widget
class TodosWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  const TodosWidget({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FloatingActionButton(
      onPressed: () async {
        await db.execute(
          'INSERT INTO lists(id, created_at, name, owner_id) VALUES(uuid(), datetime(), ?, ?)',
          ['name', '123'],
        );
      },
      tooltip: '+',
      child: const Icon(Icons.add),
    );
  }
}
```
