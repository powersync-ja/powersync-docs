title: "CRDT Data Structures"
description: "PowerSync does not use [CRDTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type) directly as part of its sync or conflict resolution process, but CRDT data structures (from a library such as [Yjs](https://github.com/yjs/yjs) or y-crdt) may be persisted and synced using PowerSync."
---

This may be useful for cases such as document editing, where last-write-wins is not sufficient for conflict resolution. PowerSync becomes the provider for CRDT data — both for local storage and for propagating changes to other clients.

### Example Implementations

For an example implementation, refer to the following demo built using the PowerSync Web SDK:
