For unit-testing your projects using PowerSync 
 (e.g. testing whether your queries run as expected) you will need the `powersync-sqlite-core` binary in your project's root directory.

1. Download the PowerSync SQLite Binary
   - Go to the PowerSync SQLite Core [Releases](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-sqlite-core/releases).
   - Download the binary compatible with your OS.
2. Rename the Binary
   - Rename the binary by removing the architecture suffix.
   - Example: powersync_x64.dll to powersync.dll
   - Example: libpowersync_aarch64.dylib to libpowersync.dylib
   - Example: libpowersync_x64.so to libpowersync.so
3. Place the binary in your project
   - Move the renamed binary to the root directory of your project.

#### If you have trouble with loading the extension confirm the following

Ensure that your SQLite3 binary install on your system has extension loading enabled. You can confirm this by doing the following
- Run `sqlite3` in your command-line interface.
- In the sqlite3 prompt run `PRAGMA compile_options;`
- Check the output for the option ENABLE_LOAD_EXTENSION.
