PowerSync generally assumes that you have some kind of "backend application" as part of your overall application architecture — whether it's Supabase, Node.js, Rails, Laravel, Django, ASP.NET, some kind of serverless cloud functions (e.g. Azure Functions, AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Cloudflare Workers, etc.), or anything else.

When you integrate PowerSync into your app project, PowerSync relies on that "backend application" for a few potential purposes:

1. **Allowing client-side write operations to be uploaded** and [applied](/handling-writes/writing-client-changes) to the backend database (Postgres, MongoDB, MySQL, or SQL Server). When you write to the client-side SQLite database provided by PowerSync, those writes are also placed into an upload queue. The PowerSync Client SDK manages uploading of those writes to your backend using the `uploadData()` function that you define in your [client-side](/configuration/app-backend/client-side-integration) _backend connector_ implementation. That `uploadData()` function should call your backend application API to apply the writes to your backend database. The reason why we designed PowerSync this way is to give you full control over things like server-side data validation and authorization of writes, while PowerSync itself requires minimal permissions.
2. **Authentication integration (optional):** Your backend is responsible for securely generating the [JWTs](/configuration/auth/overview) used by the PowerSync Client SDK to authenticate with the [PowerSync Service](/architecture/powersync-service).

### Processing Writes from Clients

- **Server-Side Implementation**: [Writing Client Changes](/handling-writes/writing-client-changes) provides guidance on how can handle write operations in your backend application.
- **Client-Side Implementation**: See [Client-Side Integration](/configuration/app-backend/client-side-integration)


### Authentication (Optional)

Some authentication providers already generate JWTs for users which PowerSync can work with directly — see [Authentication Setup](/configuration/auth/overview).

For others, some backend code must be added to your backend application to generate the JWTs needed for PowerSync — see [Custom](/configuration/auth/custom) authentication.

In your [client-side](/configuration/app-backend/client-side-integration) _backend connector_ implementation, you need to define `fetchCredentials()` function so that it returns a JWT which can be used by PowerSync Client SDK to authenticate with the [PowerSync Service](/architecture/powersync-service).


### Backend Implementation Examples

See our [Example Projects](/resources/demo-apps-example-projects#backend-examples) page for examples of custom backend implementations (e.g. Django, Node.js, Rails, etc.)

For Postgres developers, [using Supabase](/integrations/supabase/guide) is an easy alternative to a custom backend. Several of our demo apps demonstrate how to use [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) as the Postgres-based backend.


### Hosted/Managed Option for MongoDB

For developers using MongoDB as a source backend database, an alternative option to running your own backend is to use CloudCode, a serverless cloud functions environment provided by a sibling product of PowerSync. We have a template that you can use as a turnkey starting point. See the [documentation](/configuration/app-backend/cloudcode).
