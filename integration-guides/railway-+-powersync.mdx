Railway is an attractive alternative to managed solutions such as Supabase, well suited to users looking for more control without going the full IaaS route.

## Deploying to Railway

### Step 1: Deploy on Railway

Find the PowerSync template on the Railway Marketplace, or click below:

<Card
   title="Deploy on Railway"
   icon="train"
   href="https://railway.app/template/RfZi6y?referralCode=2vw%5FV9"
   horizontal
/>

### Step 2: Configure Your Database

* Create a `powersync` publication as described in the [Source Database Setup](/installation/database-setup) section.
   * Optionally filter the publication table list to only include tables that you want clients to download
* \[Optional\] Create a Postgres user for PowerSync to use as described in the [Source Database Setup](/installation/database-setup) section.

### Step 3: Configure Railway and PowerSync

* Once your project is deployed, clone the repo that Railway created and follow the instructions to generate the JWT config for these environment variables:
   * `POWERSYNC_JWT_PRIVATEKEY`
   * `POWERSYNC_JWT_PUBLICKEY`
* Sign up for a [PowerSync](https://www.powersync.com/) account
* Follow the steps to create a PowerSync instance as documented here: [Database Connection](/installation/database-connection)
   * Generate a server certificate (in PEM format) via the following command:
`echo | openssl s_client -showcerts -starttls postgres -connect <host>:<port> -servername <host> 2>/dev/null | sed -n '/BEGIN CERTIFICATE/,/END CERTIFICATE/p' | awk '/BEGIN/{i++}i==2' > railway.pem`
   * Replacing `<host>` and `<port>` values with your own.
   * In your Dashboard's connection details form, select "**verify-ca**" as the SSL mode, and upload the "railway.pem" file into the "Server Certificate" field.
* Once your instance has been provisioned, copy its instance URL (find the copy icon in the Project tree).
* Set this as the `POWERSYNC_URL` environment variable in Railway

### Step 4: Build Out Your Database

This typically consists of the below activities:

* Create your schema
* Add any new tables to the `powersync` publication previously created
* Load some test data

### Step 5: Build Out Your Backend

See the Node.js backend app for instructions:

[https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-railway-nodejs-template](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-railway-nodejs-template)

An example implementation using Firebase for auth is available here:

### Step 6: Connect Your Client

See these docs for instructions to connect your app to your backend and PowerSync: [Client-Side Setup](/installation/client-side-setup)
