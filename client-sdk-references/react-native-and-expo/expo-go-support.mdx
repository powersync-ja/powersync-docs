---

Expo Go allows you to quickly spin up a sandbox of your application without having to make a development build. Our native database adapters (OP-SQLite and React Native Quick SQLite) are not compatible with Expo Go since they require native code compilation.

# @powersync/adapter-sql-js Package

The @powersync/adapter-sql-js package provides a pure JavaScript SQLite implementation using SQL.js, allowing PowerSync to work in Expo Go without native dependencies. It uses our custom fork [powersync-sql-js](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-sql-js).

<Warning>
* This package is in an alpha release.
* **Development Use Only**
  This package will be much slower than DB adapters that use native dependencies, so we only recommend it for development. In production, switch to OP-SQLite and React Native Quick SQLite (see details below).
</Warning>

## Usage

```bash
npm install @powersync/adapter-sql-js
```

```js SystemProvider.tsx
import { SQLJSOpenFactory } from "@powersync/adapter-sql-js";
import { PowerSyncDatabase } from "@powersync/react-native";

export const powerSync = new PowerSyncDatabase({
  schema: AppSchema,
  database: new SQLJSOpenFactory({
    dbFilename: "example.db",
  }),
});
```

The default version of this adapter uses in-memory persistence, but you can specify your own `persister` option to the open factory.
Link to readme for our Expo/React example.

If you need to keep using Expo Go alongside development and production builds, you can switch between different adapters based on the Expo `executionEnvironment`.

```js SystemProvider.tsx
import { SQLJSOpenFactory } from "@powersync/adapter-sql-js";
import { PowerSyncDatabase } from "@powersync/react-native";
import Constants from "expo-constants";

const isExpoGo = Constants.executionEnvironment === "storeClient";

export const powerSync = new PowerSyncDatabase({
  schema: AppSchema,
  database: isExpoGo
    ? new SQLJSOpenFactory({
        dbFilename: "app.db",
      })
    : {
        dbFilename: "sqlite.db",
      },
});
```

## Going to Production

The @powersync/adapter-sql-js package is specifically designed to streamline the development workflow on Expo Go and will be much slower than DB adapters that use native dependencies.

For production builds we recommend switching to our [react-native-quick-sqlite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@journeyapps/react-native-quick-sqlite) or [OP-SQLite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@powersync/op-sqlite) adapters as they give substantially better performance. See [Installation](/client-sdk-references/react-native-and-expo#install-peer-dependencies) details.
