[PowerSync Cloud plans](https://www.powersync.com/pricing) have the limits and performance expectations outlined below.

The PowerSync Cloud **Team** and **Enterprise** plans allow several of these limits to be customized based on your specific needs. 

## Limits

| **Component** | **Limit** | **Details** |
|---|---|---|
| **Synced buckets per user** | 1,000 | Sync requests exceeding this will fail with an error. We plan to increase this limit in the future. |
| **Maximum row/document size** | 15MB | Applies to both source database rows and transformed rows synced to clients. |
| **Concurrent connections** | Maximum: configurable (50k+ per instance) | PowerSync Service instances have default limits configured based on the [Pricing plan](https://www.powersync.com/pricing). These limits can be increased upon request for Team and Enterprise customers, and currently scale to over 50,000 per instance.  |
| **Data hosted** | Maximum: configurable | PowerSync Service instances have default limits configured based on the [Pricing plan](https://www.powersync.com/pricing). These limits can be increased upon request for Enterprise customers. |
| **Columns per table** | 1,999 | Hard limit of the client schema, excluding the `id` column. |
| **Number of users** | No limit | No hard limit on unique users. |
| **Number of tables** | No limit | Hundreds of tables may impact startup and sync performance. |

## Performance Expectations

### Database Replication (Source DB → PowerSync Service)

- **Small rows**: 2,000-4,000 operations per second
- **Large rows**: Up to 5MB per second
- **Transaction processing**: ~60 transactions per second for smaller transactions
- **Reprocessing**: Same rates apply when reprocessing sync rules or adding new tables

### Sync (PowerSync Service → Client)

- **Rows per client**:
  - Good performance expected up to 1 million rows per client
  - Up to 10 million rows per client may still work, but this requires testing with the specific SDK
  - Increasing number of rows increases initial sync time, memory usage and database size
- **Sync speed**: Expect a rate of 2,000-20,000 operations per second per client, depending on the client
