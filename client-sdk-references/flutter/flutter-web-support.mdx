Web support for Flutter in version `^1.9.0` is currently in its alpha stage.

## Demo app

The easiest way to test Flutter Web support is to run the [Supabase Todo-List](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync.dart/tree/main/demos/supabase-todolist) demo app:

1. Checkout [the powersync.dart repo's](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync.dart/tree/main) `main` branch.
   1. **Note**: If you are an existing user updating to the latest code after a git pull, run `melos exec 'flutter pub upgrade'` in the repo's root and make sure it succeeds.
2. Run `melos prepare` in the repo's root
3. cd into the `demos/supabase-todolist` folder
4. If you havenâ€™t yet: `cp lib/app_config_template.dart lib/app_config.dart` (optionally update this config with your own Supabase and PowerSync project details).
5. Run `flutter run -d chrome`

## Installing PowerSync in your own project

Install the latest alpha version of the package, for example:

```bash
flutter pub add powersync:'^1.9.0'
```

The latest version can be found [here](https://pub.dev/packages/powersync/versions).

## Additional config

Web support requires `sqlite3.wasm` and worker (`powersync_db.worker.js` and `powersync_sync.worker.js`) assets to be served from the web application. They can be downloaded to the web directory by running the following command in your application's root folder.

```bash
dart run powersync:setup_web
```

The same code is used for initializing native and web `PowerSyncDatabase` clients.

## Limitations

The API for Web is essentially the same as for native platforms, however, some features within `PowerSyncDatabase` clients are not available.

### Imports

Flutter Web does not support importing directly from `sqlite3.dart` as it uses `dart:ffi`.

Change imports from:

```dart
import 'package/powersync/sqlite3.dart`
```

to:

```dart
import 'package/powersync/sqlite3_common.dart'
```

in code which needs to run on the Web platform. Isolated native-specific code can still import from `sqlite3.dart`.

### Database connections

Web database connections do not support concurrency. A single database connection is used. `readLock` and `writeLock` contexts do not implement checks for preventing writable queries in read connections and vice-versa.

Direct access to the synchronous `CommonDatabase` (`sqlite.Database` equivalent for web) connection is not available. `computeWithDatabase` is not available on web.
