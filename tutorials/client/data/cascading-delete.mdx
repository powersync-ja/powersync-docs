# Introduction

Since PowerSync utilizes SQLite views instead of standard tables, SQLite features like constraints, foreign keys, or cascading deletes are not available.
Currently, there is no direct support for cascading deletes on the client. However, you can achieve this by either:
1. Manually deleting all the relevant tables within a **single transaction**, OR
    <Note>
        Every local mutation performed against SQLite via the PowerSync SDK will be returned in `uploadData`. So as long as you are using `.execute()` for the mutation,
        the operation will be present in the upload queue.
    </Note>
2. Implementing triggers (which is more complex)
    <Note>
        You create triggers on the [internal tables](https://docs.powersync.com/architecture/client-architecture#schema) (not the views defined by the client schema), similar to what is
        done [here](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-js/blob/e77b1abfbed91988de1f4c707c24855cd66b2219/demos/react-supabase-todolist/src/app/utils/fts_setup.ts#L50)
    </Note>

# Example

The following example is taken from the [React Native To-Do List example app](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-js/tree/main/demos/react-native-supabase-todolist).
It showcases how to delete a `list` and all its associated `todos` in a single transaction.

```typescript
  const deleteList = async (id: string) => {
    await system.powersync.writeTransaction(async (tx) => {
      // Delete associated todos
      await tx.execute(`DELETE FROM ${TODO_TABLE} WHERE list_id = ?`, [id]);
      // Delete list record
      await tx.execute(`DELETE FROM ${LIST_TABLE} WHERE id = ?`, [id]);
    });
  };
```

<Note>
    An important thing to note is that the local SQLite database will always match the backend database, as long as the tables are in the publication, when online.
    For example, if you delete a record from the local `lists` table and Supabase cascade deletes a record from the `todo` table, PowerSync will also delete the local `todo` record when online.
