PowerSync uses OpenTelemetry to gather metrics about usage and health. This is very useful for maintenance and tracking concurrent client connections.

# What is Collected

Below are the data points collected every few minutes and associated with a random UUID representing your instance:

| dimension                         | type    |
| --------------------------------- | ------- |
| data\_replicated\_bytes           | counter |
| data\_synced\_bytes               | counter |
| rows\_replicated\_total           | counter |
| transactions\_replicated\_total   | counter |
| chunks\_replicated\_total         | counter |
| operations\_synced\_total         | counter |
| replication\_storage\_size\_bytes | gauge   |
| operation\_storage\_size\_bytes   | gauge   |
| parameter\_storage\_size\_bytes   | gauge   |
| concurrent\_connections           | gauge   |

See [https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-service/blob/main/packages/service-core/src/metrics/Metrics.ts](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-service/blob/main/packages/service-core/src/metrics/Metrics.ts) for additional details.

## Sharing Telemetry with PowerSync

Telemetry is shared with the PowerSync team unless you opt-out. This allows us to gauge adoption and usage patterns across deployments so that we can better allocate R&D capacity and ultimately better serve our customers (including you!). The metrics are linked to a random UUID and are therefore completely anonymous.


### Opting Out

To disable the sending of telemetry to PowerSync, set the `disable_telemetry_sharing` key in your [configuration file](/self-hosting/installation/powersync-service-setup#powersync-configuration) (`config.yaml` or `config.json`) to `true`:

```yaml config.yaml
telemetry:
    # Opt out of reporting anonymized usage metrics to PowerSync telemetry service
    disable_telemetry_sharing: true
```

# Managing Telemetry

## Prometheus Metrics Endpoint

PowerSync exposes instance metrics via a Prometheus-compatible endpoint. This allows you to integrate with Prometheus or other monitoring systems that scrape Prometheus endpoints.

<Info>It's not recommended to scrape the Prometheus endpoint manually, we suggest using Prometheus or other compatible tools. PowerSync does not currently support pushing to OpenTelemetry collectors.</Info>

### Configuration

1. To enable metrics, update your PowerSync YAML file to include the `prometheus_port` and set a port number.

```yaml powersync.yaml
telemetry:
  # Set the port at which the Prometheus metrics will be exposed
  prometheus_port: 9090
```

2. Update you Docker compose fle to forward the `prometheus_port`.

```yaml docker-compose.yaml
ports:
  # Forward port 8080 for the PowerSync service
  - 8080:8080
  # Forward port 9090 for Prometheus metrics
  - 9090:9090
```

Once enabled, restart the service and the metrics endpoint will return Prometheus-formatted metrics, as described in the [What is Collected](#whatiscollected) section on this page.

<Note>If you're running multiple containers (e.g. splitting up replication containers and API containers) you need to scrape the metrics separately for each container.</Note>
