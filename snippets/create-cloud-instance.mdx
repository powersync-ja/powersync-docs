1. In the **Overview** workspace of the [PowerSync Dashboard](/usage/tools/powersync-dashboard), you will be prompted to create your first instance:
  <Frame>
    <img src="/images/installation/overview-create-instance.png" />
  </Frame>
  <Note>
    If you've previously created an instance in your project, you can create an additional instance by navigating to **Manage instances** and clicking **Create new instance**:
    <img src="/images/installation/create-new-instance.png" width="40%" />
    You can also create an entirely new [project](/usage/tools/powersync-dashboard#hierarchy%3A-organization%2C-project%2C-instance) with its own set of instances. Click on the PowerSync icon in the top left corner of the Dashboard or on **Admin Portal** at the top of the Dashboard, and then click on **Create Project**. 
  </Note>
2. Give your instance a name, such as "Testing".
3. [Optional] You can change the default cloud region from US to EU, JP (Japan), AU (Australia) or BR (Brazil) if desired.
   * Note: Additional cloud regions will be considered on request, especially for customers on our Enterprise plan. Please [contact us](/resources/contact-us) if you need a different region.
4. [Optional] You can opt in to using the `Next` version of the Service, which may contain early access or experimental features. Always use the `Stable` version in production.
