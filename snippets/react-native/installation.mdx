Add the [PowerSync React Native NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@powersync/react-native) to your project:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="npm">
    ```bash
    npx expo install @powersync/react-native
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn expo add @powersync/react-native
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="pnpm">
    ```
    pnpm expo install @powersync/react-native
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Install peer dependencies

PowerSync requires a SQLite database adapter. 

<Tip>
**Using Expo Go?** Our native database adapters listed below (OP-SQLite and React Native Quick SQLite) are not compatible with Expo Go's sandbox environment. To run PowerSync with Expo Go install our JavaScript-based adapter `@powersync/adapter-sql-js` instead. See details [here](/client-sdk-references/react-native-and-expo/expo-go-support).
</Tip>

Choose between:

**OP-SQLite (Recommended)**

[PowerSync OP-SQLite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@powersync/op-sqlite) offers:
- Built-in encryption support via SQLCipher
- Smoother transition to React Native's New Architecture

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="npm">
    ```bash
    npx expo install @powersync/op-sqlite @op-engineering/op-sqlite
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn expo add @powersync/op-sqlite @op-engineering/op-sqlite
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="pnpm">
    ```
    pnpm expo install @powersync/op-sqlite @op-engineering/op-sqlite
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**React Native Quick SQLite**

The [@journeyapps/react-native-quick-sqlite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@journeyapps/react-native-quick-sqlite) package is the original database adapter for React Native and therefore more battle-tested in production environments.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="npm">
    ```bash
    npx expo install @journeyapps/react-native-quick-sqlite
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn expo add @journeyapps/react-native-quick-sqlite
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="pnpm">
    ```
    pnpm expo install @journeyapps/react-native-quick-sqlite
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
  **Polyfills and additional notes:**
  
  - For async iterator support with watched queries, additional polyfills are required. See the [Babel plugins section](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@powersync/react-native#babel-plugins-watched-queries) in the README.
  
  - By default, this SDK connects to a PowerSync instance via WebSocket (from `@powersync/react-native@1.11.0`) or HTTP streaming (before `@powersync/react-native@1.11.0`). See [Developer Notes](/client-sdk-references/react-native-and-expo#developer-notes) for more details on connection methods and platform-specific requirements.

  - When using the OP-SQLite package, we recommend adding this [metro config](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-js/tree/main/packages/react-native#metro-config-optional)
    to avoid build issues.
