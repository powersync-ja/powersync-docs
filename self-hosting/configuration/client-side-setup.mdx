For development and testing, you can use [development tokens](/configuration/auth/development-tokens) as described in the [Setup Guide](/intro/setup-guide).

For production deployments, you'll need to configure proper authentication. PowerSync supports JWT-based authentication from various providers. Configure authentication in your PowerSync Service `config.yaml` file under the `client_auth` section.

## Supabase Auth

If you are using Supabase authentication, PowerSync can verify JWTs for users directly.

Under `client_auth` in your config file, enable Supabase authentication:

```yaml config.yaml
client_auth:
  # Enable this if using Supabase Auth
  supabase: true
  supabase_jwt_secret: your-secret
```

For more details, see [Supabase Auth](/configuration/auth/supabase-auth).

## Firebase Auth

If you are using Firebase authentication, configure your Firebase JWKS URI and audience.

* JWKS URI: `https://www.googleapis.com/service_accounts/v1/jwk/securetoken@system.gserviceaccount.com`
* JWT Audience: Your Firebase project ID

```yaml config.yaml
client_auth:
  # JWKS URIs can be specified here.
  jwks_uri: 'https://www.googleapis.com/service_accounts/v1/jwk/securetoken@system.gserviceaccount.com'
  audience: ['<your Firebase project ID>']
```

For more details, see [Firebase Auth](/configuration/auth/firebase-auth).

## Custom Auth

For custom authentication providers or implementations, PowerSync supports both RS256 and HS256 algorithms.

You can configure authentication using either:
- A JWKS URI endpoint
- Static public keys in the configuration file

```yaml config.yaml
client_auth:
  # Option 1: JWKS URI endpoint
  jwks_uri: http://demo-backend:6060/api/auth/keys

  # Option 2: Static collection of public keys for JWT verification
  # jwks:
  #   keys:
  #     - kty: 'RSA'
  #       n: '${PS_JWK_N}'
  #       e: '${PS_JWK_E}'
  #       alg: 'RS256'
  #       kid: '${PS_JWK_KID}'

  audience: ['powersync-dev', 'powersync']
```

For more details, see [Custom Auth](/configuration/auth/custom).
