---

Expo Go is a sandbox environment that allows you to quickly test your application without building a development build. Our native SQLite database adapters for React Native apps (OP-SQLite and React Native Quick SQLite) cannot run in Expo Go because they require native code compilation. Specifically, PowerSync needs a SQLite implementation that can load our [Rust core extension](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-sqlite-core), which isn't possible in Expo Go's prebuilt app container. To enable PowerSync in Expo Go, we provide a JavaScript-based database adapter: [`@powersync/adapter-sql-js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@powersync/adapter-sql-js).

# @powersync/adapter-sql-js

A development package for PowerSync which uses SQL.js to provide a pure JavaScript SQLite implementation. This eliminates the need for native dependencies and enables development with Expo Go and other JavaScript-only environments. Both SQLite and PowerSync's Rust core extension are compiled to JavaScript using Emscripten. Under the hood, it uses our custom fork [powersync-sql-js](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-sql-js).

<Warning>

This package is in an **alpha** release.

**Expo Go Sandbox Environment Only** This adapter is specifically designed for Expo Go and similar JavaScript-only environments. It will be much slower than native database adapters and has limitations. Every write operation triggers a complete rewrite of the entire database file to persistent storage, not just the changed data. In addition to the performance overheads, this adapter doesn't provide any of the SQLite consistency guarantees - you may end up with missing data or a corrupted database file if the app is killed while writing to the database file.

</Warning>

## Usage

```bash
npm install @powersync/adapter-sql-js
```

```js SystemProvider.tsx
import { SQLJSOpenFactory } from "@powersync/adapter-sql-js";
import { PowerSyncDatabase } from "@powersync/react-native";

export const powerSync = new PowerSyncDatabase({
  schema: AppSchema,
  database: new SQLJSOpenFactory({
    dbFilename: "example.db",
  }),
});
```

### Data Persistence

The default version of this adapter uses in-memory persistence, but you can specify your own `persister` option to the open factory.
See an example in the package [README](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@powersync/adapter-sql-js).

## Moving Beyond Expo Go

When you're ready to move beyond the Expo Go sandbox environment - whether for native development builds or production deployment - we recommend switching to our native database adapters:

- [OP-SQLite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@powersync/op-sqlite) (Recommended) - Offers built-in encryption support and better React Native New Architecture compatibility
- [React Native Quick SQLite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@journeyapps/react-native-quick-sqlite) - Our original native adapter

These adapters provide better performance, full SQLite consistency guarantees, and are suitable for both development builds and production deployment. See the SDKs [Installation](/client-sdk-references/react-native-and-expo#install-peer-dependencies) details for setup instructions.

### Switching Between Adapters - Example

If you want to keep using Expo Go alongside development and production builds, you can switch between different adapters based on the Expo `executionEnvironment`:

```js SystemProvider.tsx
import { SQLJSOpenFactory } from "@powersync/adapter-sql-js";
import { PowerSyncDatabase } from "@powersync/react-native";
import Constants from "expo-constants";

const isExpoGo = Constants.executionEnvironment === "storeClient";

export const powerSync = new PowerSyncDatabase({
  schema: AppSchema,
  database: isExpoGo
    ? new SQLJSOpenFactory({
        dbFilename: "app.db",
      })
    : {
        dbFilename: "sqlite.db",
      },
});
```
