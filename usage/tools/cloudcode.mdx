title: CloudCode (for MongoDB Backend Functionality)
description:
---

As of January 2025, we've started adding optional backend functionality for PowerSync that handles writing to a backend database (with initial support for MongoDB) and generating JWTs.

This makes PowerSync easier to implement for developers who prefer not having to maintain their own backend code and infrastructure (PowerSync's [usual architecture](/installation/app-backend-setup) is to use your own backend to process writes and generate JWTs).

We are approaching this in phases, and phase 1 allows using the CloudCode feature of JourneyApps Platform, a [sibling product](https://www.powersync.com/company) of PowerSync. [CloudCode](https://docs.journeyapps.com/reference/cloudcode/cloudcode-overview) is a serverless cloud functions engine based on Node.js and AWS Lambda. It's provided as a fully-managed service running on the same cloud infrastructure as the rest of PowerSync Cloud. PowerSync and JourneyApps Platform share the same login system, so you don’t need to create a separate account to use CloudCode. 

<Info>
    We are currently making JourneyApps Platform CloudCode available for free to all our customers who use PowerSync with MongoDB. It does require a bit of "white glove" onboarding from our team. [Contact us](/resources/contact-us) if you want to use this functionality.
</Info>

Phase 2 on our roadmap involves fully integrating CloudCode into the PowerSync Cloud environment. For more details, see [this post on our blog](https://www.powersync.com/blog/turnkey-backend-functionality-conflict-resolution-for-powersync).


# Using CloudCode in JourneyApps Platform for MongoDB Backend Functionality

There is a MongoDB template available in CloudCode that provides the backend functionality needed for a PowerSync MongoDB implementation. Here is how to use it:

## Create a new JourneyApps Platform project

To create a new JourneyApps Platform project in order to use CloudCode:

<Steps>
    <Step>
        Navigate to the [JourneyApps Admin Portal](https://accounts.journeyapps.com/portal/admin). You should see a list of your projects if you've created any.
        <Frame>
            <img src="/images/usage/tools/JourneyApps_Project_1.png" />
        </Frame>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Select **Create Project** at the top right of the screen.
        <Frame>
            <img src="/images/usage/tools/JourneyApps_Project_2.png" />
        </Frame>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Select **JourneyApps Platform Project** and click **Next**.
        <Frame>
            <img src="/images/usage/tools/JourneyApps_Project_3.png" />

        <Frame>
            <img src="/images/usage/tools/JourneyApps_Project_4.png" />
        </Frame>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        There are options available for managing version control for the project. For simplicity we recommend selecting **Basic (Revisions)** and **JourneyApps** as the Git provider.
        <Frame>
            <img src="/images/usage/tools/JourneyApps_Project_5.png" />
        </Frame>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Select **TypeScript** as your template language, and `MongoDB CRUD & Auth Backend` as your template. Then click **Create App**.
        <Frame>
            <img src="/images/usage/tools/JourneyApps_Project_6.png" />
        </Frame>
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Overview of the CloudCode tasks created from the template

To view the CloudCode tasks that were created in the new project using this template, select **CloudCode** at the top of the IDE:

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/usage/tools/CloudCode.png" />
</Frame>

Here you will find four CloudCode tasks:
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/usage/tools/CloudCode-tasks.png" />
</Frame>

Here's the purpose of each task:

1. `generate_keys` - This is a task that can be used to generate a private/public key pair which the `jwks` and `token` tasks (see below) require.

<Warning>
    The `generate_keys` task does not expose an HTTP endpoint and should only be used for development and getting started.
</Warning>
2. `jwks` - This task [exposes an HTTP endpoint](https://docs.journeyapps.com/reference/cloudcode/triggering-a-cloudcode-task/trigger-cc-via-http) which has a `GET` function which returns the public [JWKS](https://stytch.com/blog/understanding-jwks/) details.
3. `token` - This task exposes an HTTP endpoint which has a `GET` function. The task is used by a PowerSync client to generate a token to validate against the PowerSync Service.
For more information about custom authentication setups for PowerSync, please [see here](https://docs.powersync.com/installation/authentication-setup/custom).
4. `upload` - This task exposes an HTTP endpoint which has a `POST` function which is used to process the write events from a PowerSync client and writes it back to the source MongoDB database.

## Setup

### 1. Generate key pair
Before using the CloudCode tasks, you need to generate a public/private key pair. Do the following to generate the key pair:
1. Open the `generate_keys` CloudCode task.
2. Select the **Test CloudCode Task** button at the top right. This will print the public and private key in the task logs window.
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/usage/tools/test-cloudcode-task.png" />
</Frame>
3. Copy and paste the `POWERSYNC_PUBLIC_KEY` and `POWERSYNC_PRIVATE_KEY` to a file — we'll need this in the next step.

<Note>
    This step is only meant for testing and development because the keys are shown in the log files.
    For production, [generate a key pair locally](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-jwks-example?tab=readme-ov-file#1-generate-a-key-pair) and move onto step 2 and 3.
</Note>

### 2. Configure a deployment
Before using the tasks, we need to configure a "deployment".
1. At the top of the IDE, select **Deployments**.
2. Create a new deployment by using the **+** button at the top right, _or_ use the default `Testing` deployment. You can configure different deployments for different environments (e.g. staging, production)
3. Now select the **Deployment settings** button for the instance.
4. In the **Deployment settings** - **General** tab, capture a **Domain** value in the text field. This domain name determines where the HTTP endpoints exposed by these CloudCode tasks can be accessed. The application will validate the domain name to make sure it's available.
5. Select **Save**.
6. Deploy the deployment: you can do so by selecting the **Deploy app** button, which can be found on the far right for each of the deployments you have configured. After the deployment is completed, it will take a few minutes for the domain to be available.
7. Your new domain will be available at `<domain_name>.poweredbyjourney.com`. Open the browser and navigate to the new domain. You should be presented with `Cannot GET /`, because there is no index route.

### 3. Configure environment variables

To wrap up the deployment, we need to configure some environment variables. The following variables need to be set on the deployment:

* `POWERSYNC_PUBLIC_KEY` - This is the `POWERSYNC_PUBLIC_KEY` from the values generated in step 1.
* `POWERSYNC_PRIVATE_KEY` - This is the `POWERSYNC_PRIVATE_KEY` from the values generated in step 1.
* `MONGO_URI` - This is the MongoDB URI e.g. `mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<database_domain>/<database>`
* `POWERSYNC_URL` - This is the public PowerSync URL that is provided after creating a new PowerSync instance.

To add environment variables, do the following:
1. Head over to the **Deployment settings** option again.
2. Select the **Environment Variables** tab.
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/usage/tools/cloudcode-envvar.png" />
</Frame>
3. Capture the variable name in the **Name** text field.
4. Capture the variable value in the **Value** text field.
5. (Suggested) Check the **Masked** checkbox to obfuscate the variable value for security purposes.
6. Repeat until all the variables are added.

To finalize the setup, do the following:
1. Select the **Save** button. This is important, otherwise the variables will not save.
2. Deploy the deployment: you can do so by selecting the **Deploy app** button.

### 4. Test
Open your browser and navigate to `<domain_name>.poweredbyjourney.com/jwks`.

If the setup was successful, the `jwks` task will render the keys in JSON format. Make sure the format of your JWKS keys matches the format [in this example](https://hlstmcktecziostiaplz.supabase.co/functions/v1/powersync-jwks) JWKS endpoint.

## Usage
Make sure you've configured a deployment and set up environment variables as described in the **Setup** steps above before using the HTTP API endpoints exposed by the CloudCode tasks:

### Token
You would call the `token` HTTP API endpoint when you [implement](/installation/client-side-setup/integrating-with-your-backend) the `fetchCredentials()` function on the client application.

Send an HTTP GET request to `<domain_name>.poweredbyjourney.com/token?user_id=<user_id>` to fetch a JWT for a user. You must provide a `user_id` in the query string of the request, as this is included in the JWT that is generated.

The response of the request would look like this:
```json
{"token":"..."}
```

### JWKS
The `jwks` HTTP API endpoint is used by PowerSync to validate the token returned from the `<domain_name>.poweredbyjourney.com/token` endpoint. This URL must be set in the configuration of your PowerSync instance.

Send an HTTP GET request to `<domain_name>.poweredbyjourney.com/jwks`.

An example of the response format can be found using [this link](https://hlstmcktecziostiaplz.supabase.co/functions/v1/powersync-jwks).

### Upload
You would call the `upload` HTTP API endpoint when you [implement](/installation/client-side-setup/integrating-with-your-backend) the `uploadData()` function on the client application.

Send an HTTP POST request to `<domain_name>.poweredbyjourney.com/upload`.

The body of the request payload should look like this:
```
{
  "op": "PUT",
  "table": "lists",
  "id": "61d19021-0565-4686-acc4-3ea4f8c48839",
  "data": {
    "created_at": "2024-10-31 10:33:24",
    "name": "Name",
    "owner_id": "8ea4310a-b7c0-4dd7-ae54-51d6e1596b83"
  }
}
```

The API will respond with HTTP status `200` if the write was successful.


## Customization required

You can make changes to the way the `upload` task writes data to the source MongoDB database. At a minimum, you will need to modify it to take your specific MongoDB database "schema" into consideration. 

Here is how:

1. Open the **CloudCode** section at the top of the IDE.
2. Select and expand the `upload` task in the panel on the left.
3. The `index.ts` contains the entry point function that accepts the HTTP request.
4. The `persister.ts` file connects to the MongoDB database and writes the data to the MongoDB database. You can update this file to introduce your database schema. The default template has an example schema for a To-Do List application:

```typescript
/**
* Line 13 in upload/persister.ts
* Sample schema using to-do list demo. Update this based on your DB schema.
*/
export const schema = {
    lists: {
        _id: types.string,
        created_at: types.date,
        name: types.string,
        owner_id: types.string
    },
    todos: {
        _id: types.string,
        completed: types.boolean,
        created_at: types.date,
        created_by: types.string,
        description: types.string,
        list_id: types.string,
        completed_at: types.date,
        completed_by: types.string
    }
};
```

## Production considerations

Before going into production with this solution, you will need to set up authentication on the HTTP endpoints exposed by the CloudCode tasks. Please [contact us](/resources/contact-us) for assistance.
