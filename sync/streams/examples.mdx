Explore working demo apps that demonstrate Sync Streams in action.

## Demo Apps

These demo apps show how to combine auto-subscribe streams (for data that should always be available) with on-demand streams (for data loaded when needed).

<Tabs>
<Tab title="JS">
Try the [`react-supabase-todolist-sync-streams`](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-js/tree/main/demos/react-supabase-todolist-sync-streams) demo app by following the instructions in the README.

In this demo:
- The app syncs `lists` by default, so they're available immediately and offline (demonstrating auto-subscribe behavior).
- The app syncs `todos` on demand when a user opens a list (demonstrating subscription parameters).
- When the user navigates back to the same list, they won't see a loading state, because the data is cached locally (demonstrating TTL caching behavior).
</Tab>
<Tab title="Dart">
Try the [`supabase-todolist`](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync.dart/tree/main/demos/supabase-todolist) demo app, which supports Sync Streams.

Deploy the following Sync Streams configuration:

```yaml
config:
  edition: 2

streams:
  lists:
    query: SELECT * FROM lists
    auto_subscribe: true
  todos:
    query: SELECT * FROM todos WHERE list_id = subscription.parameter('list')
```

In this demo:
- The app syncs `lists` by default, so they're available immediately and offline (demonstrating auto-subscribe behavior).
- The app syncs `todos` on demand when a user opens a list (demonstrating subscription parameters).
- When the user navigates back to the same list, they won't see a loading state, because the data is cached locally (demonstrating TTL caching behavior).

## Common Patterns

### Todo List with On-Demand Loading

A classic pattern: sync the list of lists upfront, but only sync todos when the user opens a specific list.

```yaml
config:
  edition: 2

streams:
  # Always available - user can see their lists offline
  lists:
    query: SELECT * FROM lists WHERE owner_id = auth.user_id()
    auto_subscribe: true

  # Loaded on demand - only sync todos for the list being viewed
  list_todos:
    query: |
      SELECT * FROM todos 
      WHERE list_id = subscription.parameter('list_id')
        AND list_id IN (SELECT id FROM lists WHERE owner_id = auth.user_id())
```

Client usage:

```js
// Lists are already synced (auto_subscribe: true)
const lists = await db.getAll('SELECT * FROM lists');

// When user opens a list, subscribe to its todos
const sub = await db.syncStream('list_todos', { list_id: selectedListId }).subscribe();
await sub.waitForFirstSync();

// Todos are now available locally
const todos = await db.getAll('SELECT * FROM todos WHERE list_id = ?', [selectedListId]);
```

### Project Workspace

Sync project metadata upfront, but load project contents on demand.

```yaml
config:
  edition: 2

streams:
  # User's projects - always available for navigation
  my_projects:
    query: SELECT * FROM projects WHERE owner_id = auth.user_id()
    auto_subscribe: true

  # Project details - loaded when user opens a project
  project_tasks:
    query: |
      SELECT * FROM tasks 
      WHERE project_id = subscription.parameter('project_id')
        AND project_id IN (SELECT id FROM projects WHERE owner_id = auth.user_id())

  project_files:
    query: |
      SELECT * FROM files 
      WHERE project_id = subscription.parameter('project_id')
        AND project_id IN (SELECT id FROM projects WHERE owner_id = auth.user_id())
```

### Chat Application

Sync conversation list upfront, load messages on demand.

```yaml
config:
  edition: 2

streams:
  # User's conversations - always show the conversation list
  my_conversations:
    query: |
      SELECT * FROM conversations 
      WHERE id IN (SELECT conversation_id FROM participants WHERE user_id = auth.user_id())
    auto_subscribe: true

  # Messages - only load for the active conversation
  conversation_messages:
    query: |
      SELECT * FROM messages 
      WHERE conversation_id = subscription.parameter('conversation_id')
        AND conversation_id IN (
          SELECT conversation_id FROM participants WHERE user_id = auth.user_id()
        )
```
