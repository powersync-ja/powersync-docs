description: "The 'backend connector' provides the connection between the PowerSync Client SDK and your backend application."

After you've [instantiated](/installation/client-side-setup/instantiate-powersync-database) the client-side PowerSync database, you will call `connect()` on it, which causes the PowerSync Client SDK to connect to the [PowerSync Service](/architecture/powersync-service) for the purpose of syncing data to the client-side SQLite database, _and_ to connect to your backend application as needed, for two purposes:

| Purpose | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Uploading writes to your backend:** | Writes that are made to the client-side SQLite database are uploaded to your backend application, where you control how they're applied to your backend database (Postgres, MongoDB or MySQL). This is how PowerSync achieves bi-directional syncing of data. |
| **Authentication integration:** | PowerSync uses JWTs for authentication between the Client SDK and PowerSync Service. Your backend application should be able to generate JWTs that the PowerSync Client SDK can retrieve and use for authentication against your [PowerSync Service](/architecture/powersync-service) instance. |

Accordingly, you must pass a _backend connector_ as an argument when you call `connect()` on the client-side PowerSync database. You must define that backend connector, and it must implement two functions/methods:

| Purpose | Function | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Uploading writes to your backend:** | `uploadData()` | The PowerSync Client SDK automatically calls this function to upload client-side write operations to your backend. Whenever you write to the client-side SQLite database, those writes are also automatically placed into an _upload queue_ by the Client SDK, and the Client SDK processes the entries in the upload queue by calling `uploadData()`. You should define your `uploadData()` function to call your backend application API to upload and apply the write operations to your backend database. The Client SDK automatically handles retries in the case of failures. See [Writing Client Changes](/installation/app-backend-setup/writing-client-changes) for considerations on the backend implementation. |
| **Authentication integration:** | `fetchCredentials()` | This is called every couple of minutes and is used to obtain a JWT from your backend. The PowerSync Client SDK uses that JWT to authenticate against the PowerSync Service. See [Authentication Setup](/installation/authentication-setup) for instructions on how the JWTs should be generated. |
