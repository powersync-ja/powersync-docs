The typical components of a self-hosted production environment are:

<Frame caption="Self-hosted PowerSync architecture">
  ![](/images/self-hosting/powersync-architecture-diagram-self-host.png)
</Frame>

The self-hosted deployment is run via Docker. A Docker image is distributed via [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/journeyapps/powersync-service). Run PowerSync using:

```bash
docker run \
-p 8080:80 \
-e POWERSYNC_CONFIG_B64="$(base64 -i ./config.yaml)" \
--network my-local-dev-network \
--name my-powersync journeyapps/powersync-service:latest
```

In the above example, the service configuration is injected as an environment variable (which contains the base64 encoding of a config YAML file), but it's also possible to use a config file mounted on a volume or specified as a command line parameter. Both YAML and JSON config files are supported.

See [here](https://github.com/powersync-ja/self-host-demo/blob/main/config/powersync.yaml) for detailed comments on the config file options.

In order to run the PowerSync Service, the following activities are required:
