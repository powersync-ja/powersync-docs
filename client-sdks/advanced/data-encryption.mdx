### In Transit Encryption

Data is always encrypted in transit using TLS — both between the client and PowerSync, and between PowerSync [and the source database](/usage/lifecycle-maintenance/postgres-maintenance#tls).

### At Rest Encryption

The client-side database can be encrypted at rest. This is currently available for:

<Accordion title="Dart/Flutter" icon="flutter">
[SQLCipher](https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/) support is available for Dart/Flutter through the `powersync_sqlcipher` SDK. See usage details in the package README:

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="React Native & Expo" icon="react">
 [SQLCipher](https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/) support is available for PowerSync's React Native SDK through the `@powersync/op-sqlite` package. See usage details in the package README:

<Card

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="JavaScript Web" icon="js">
 The Web SDK uses the [ChaCha20 cipher algorithm by default](https://utelle.github.io/SQLite3MultipleCiphers/docs/ciphers/cipher_chacha20/). See usage details in the package README:

<Card
  title="npm: @powersync/web"

  Additionally, a minimal example demonstrating encryption of the web database is available [here](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-js/tree/main/demos/example-vite-encryption). 
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Node.js" icon="node-js">
Encryption support is available for PowerSync's Node.js SDK using [`better-sqlite3-multiple-ciphers`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/better-sqlite3-multiple-ciphers). See usage details and code examples in the [Node.js SDK reference](/client-sdk-references/node#encryption-and-custom-sqlite-drivers).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Kotlin" icon="k">
Encryption support is available for PowerSync's Kotlin SDK using [`SQLite3MultipleCiphers`](https://utelle.github.io/SQLite3MultipleCiphers/). This allows you to encrypt your local SQLite database with various cipher algorithms.

For implementation details see [`sqlite3multipleciphers`](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-kotlin/tree/main/sqlite3multipleciphers) in the PowerSync Kotlin SDK.
</Accordion>

<Note>
  Support for encryption on other platforms is planned. In the meantime, let us know your needs and use cases on [Discord](https://discord.gg/powersync).

### End-to-end Encryption

For end-to-end encryption, the encrypted data can be synced using PowerSync. The data can then either be encrypted and decrypted directly in memory by the application, or a separate local-only table can be used to persist the decrypted data — allowing querying the data directly.

[Raw SQLite Tables](/client-sdks/advanced/raw-tables) can be used for full control over the SQLite schema and managing tables for the decrypted data. We have a [React & Supabase example app](https://github.com/powersync-community/react-supabase-chat-e2ee) that demonstrates this approach. See also the accompanying [blog post](https://www.powersync.com/blog/building-an-e2ee-chat-app-with-powersync-supabase).
