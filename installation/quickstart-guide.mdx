PowerSync is designed to be stack agnostic, and currently supports [Postgres](/installation/database-setup#postgres), [MongoDB](/installation/database-setup#mongodb), [MySQL](/installation/database-setup#mysql-beta) (Beta), and [SQL Server](/installation/database-setup#sql-server-alpha) (Alpha) as the backend source database, and has the following official client-side SDKs available:
- [**Dart/Flutter**](/client-sdks/guides/flutter) (mobile and [web](/client-sdks/frameworks/flutter-web-support)) 
- [**React Native**](/client-sdks/guides/react-native-and-expo) (mobile and [web](/client-sdks/frameworks/react-native-web-support)) 
- [**JavaScript Web**](/client-sdks/guides/javascript-web) (including integrations for React, Vue and TanStack)
- [**Capacitor**](/client-sdks/guides/capacitor) (alpha)
- [**Node.js**](/client-sdks/guides/node) (beta)
- [**Kotlin**](/client-sdks/guides/kotlin)
- [**Swift**](/client-sdks/guides/swift)
- [**.NET**](/client-sdks/guides/dotnet) (alpha)

<Note>
Support for additional platforms is on our [Roadmap](https://roadmap.powersync.com/). If one isn't supported today, please add your vote or submit a new idea on our roadmap, and check back soon.

<Note>
**Postgres Developers: Using Supabase?** If you are using [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) as your backend, we provide a [PowerSync\<>Supabase](/integrations/supabase/guide) integration guide which includes a tutorial and demo app to quickly learn how to use PowerSync with Supabase.

## Implementation Outline

<LocalOnly />

The following outlines our recommended steps to implement PowerSync in your project:

<Steps>
  <Step title="[Optional] Create a PowerSync Cloud account">
    Sign up for a free PowerSync Cloud account [here](https://accounts.journeyapps.com/portal/powersync-signup?s=docs) if you want to use our cloud-hosted service. PowerSync can also be self-hosted — see instructions in step 3.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your Source Database">
    Configure your source database for PowerSync — see [Source Database Setup](/configuration/source-db/setup).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect PowerSync to your Database">
    Connect your database to your instance of the PowerSync Service:
      1. Using PowerSync Cloud: See [Database Connection](/configuration/source-db/connection)
      2. Using self-hosted PowerSync: Refer to [this section](/self-hosting/configuration/service-configuration).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Basic Sync Rules">
    Define [Sync Rules](/sync/rules/overview) in PowerSync — this enables dynamic partial replication: syncing just a relevant subset of data to each user/client instead of your entire database.
    - Learn about Sync Rules in our introductory [blog post](https://www.powersync.com/blog/sync-rules-from-first-principles-partial-replication-to-sqlite).
    - We recommend starting with one or two simple [Global Data](/sync/rules/global-data) queries.
  </Step>
  <Step title="[Optional] Generate a Development Token">
    Generate a [Development Token](/configuration/auth/development-tokens) so you can get up and running quickly, without implementing full authentication integration yet.
  </Step>
  <Step title="[Optional] Test Sync with the Sync Diagnostics Client">
    Use our hosted [Sync Diagnostics Client](https://diagnostics-app.powersync.com) to validate that your backend source database is syncing into SQLite as expected based on your Sync Rules.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implement PowerSync on the Client-Side">
    Implement PowerSync in your app using one of our Client SDKs:
   1. At this point, we recommend continuing to use your Development Token from step 5 for simplicity.
   2. To get a quick feel for PowerSync, you may want to implement a "Hello World" app as a start. Or you can jump straight into installing the client SDK in your existing app. See [Client-Side Setup](/installation/client-side-setup) or follow end-to-end getting started instructions in the [full SDK reference](/client-sdks/overview).
   3. Verify that downloads from your source database are working. Data should reflect in your UI and you can also [inspect the SQLite database](/resources/troubleshooting#inspect-local-sqlite-database).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implement Authentication">
   Implement authentication for clients (JWT-based) — see our [docs here](/configuration/auth/overview).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your Backend Application">
   Implement your [backend application](/installation/app-backend-setup) to accept and process writes from clients.
    - We have backend examples available [here](/resources/demo-apps-example-projects#backend-examples) for environments like Node.js, Django and Rails.
