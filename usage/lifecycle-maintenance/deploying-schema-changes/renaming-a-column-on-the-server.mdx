title: "Renaming a Column on the Server"
description: "Use the `ifnull` function in Sync Rules to output whichever column is available. This would handle both the old and new schema versions:"
---

```sql
SELECT IFNULL(description_new, description_old) AS description FROM assets
```

This may produce a validation error because of a missing column, but PowerSync will still allow the deploy.

Once the changes have been deployed and replicated, the old reference can be removed from the Sync Rules:

```sql
SELECT description_new AS description FROM assets
```
