## Migrations

Migrations run automatically by default.

```yaml
# powersync.yaml

migrations:
    # Setting this to false (default) enables automatic migrations on startup.
    # When set to true, migrations must be triggered manually by modifying the container `command`.
    disable_auto_migration: true
```
MongoDB locks ensure migrations are executed exactly once, even when multiple containers start simultaneously.

## Backups

We recommend using Git to backup your configuration files.

The sync bucket storage database doesn't require backups as it can be easily reconstructed.
