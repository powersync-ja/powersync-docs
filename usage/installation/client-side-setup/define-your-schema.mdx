title: "Define your Schema"
description: "You need to set up your client-side schema in your app project. This involves defining your schema in code using the PowerSync syntax."
---

This schema represents a "view" of the downloaded data. No migrations are required — the schema is applied directly when the local PowerSync SQLite database is constructed.

<Info>
**Generate schema automatically (PowerSync Cloud)**

In the [PowerSync Dashboard](/usage/tools/powersync-dashboard), the schema can be generated based off your [Sync Rules](/usage/sync-rules) by right-clicking on an instance and selecting **Generate client-side schema**. Currently, the schema can be generated in JavaScript or Dart. Support for Kotlin is coming soon.

Similar functionality exists in the PowerSync [CLI](/usage/tools/cli).
