<Warning>
Raw tables are an experimental feature for the purpose of getting feedback from users and refining the APIs.
</Warning>

Raw tables allow you to define native SQLite tables in the client-side schema, bypassing PowerSync's default [JSON-based view system](/architecture/client-architecture#schema). This eliminates overhead associated with extracting values from the JSON data and provides access to advanced SQLite features like foreign key constraints and custom indexes.

<Note>
*Availability**

Raw tables were introduced in the following versions of our client SDKs:

## When to Use Raw Tables

Consider raw tables when you need:

- **Advanced SQLite features** like `FOREIGN KEY` and `ON DELETE CASCADE` constraints
- **Indexes** - PowerSync's default schema has limited support for indexes (todo: elaborate), while raw tables give you complete control to create indexes on expressions, use `GENERATED` columns, etc
- **Improved performance** for complex queries (e.g., `SELECT SUM(value) FROM transactions`) - raw tables more efficiently get these values directly from the SQLite column, instead of extracting the value from the JSON object on every row
- **Reduced storage overhead** - eliminate JSON object overhead for each row in `ps_data__<table>.data` column
- **To manually create tables** - Sometimes you need full control over table creation, for example when implementing custom triggers
  
## How Raw Tables Work

### Current JSON-Based System

Currently the sync system involves two general steps:

1. Download sync bucket operations from the PowerSync Service
2. Once the client has a complete checkpoint and no local changes, sync the local database with the bucket operations

The bucket operations use JSON to store the individual operation data. The local database uses tables with a simple schemaless `ps_data__<table_name>` structure.

PowerSync then creates views on that table that extract JSON fields to resemble standard tables.

### Raw Tables Approach

At a high level, raw tables consist of two components:

1. **Schema definition** - Define the raw table in your schema with a table name used by the PowerSync Service so it knows to forward operations to your table instead of the default `ps_data__<table>`

2. **Custom SQL statements** - SQL statements to log updates in the upload queue:

   **Upsert statement** - SQL statement to run for `PUT` operations, using prepared statement parameters that can reference the row ID or extract values from JSON data:
   ```sql
   todo simple example
   ```

   **Delete statement** - SQL statement to run for `REMOVE` operations:
   ```sql
   todo simple example
   ```
