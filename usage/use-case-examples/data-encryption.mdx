### In Transit Encryption

Data is always encrypted in transit using TLS — both between the client and PowerSync, and between PowerSync [and the source database](/usage/lifecycle-maintenance/postgres-maintenance#tls).

### At Rest Encryption

The client-side database can be encrypted at rest using [SQLCipher](https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/).&#x20;

SQLCipher support is currently available for our React Native SDK through the `@powersync/op-sqlite` package. See usage details in the package README:

Support for SQLCipher on other platforms is planned. In the meantime, let us know with your needs and use cases on [Discord](https://discord.gg/powersync).

### End-to-end Encryption

For end-to-end encryption, the encrypted data can be synced using PowerSync. The data can then either be encrypted and decrypted directly in memory by the application, or a separate local-only table can be used to persist the decrypted data — allowing querying the data directly.

An example implementation is coming soon.
