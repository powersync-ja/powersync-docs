The fastest way to get started with self-hosting PowerSync is to follow our main [Quickstart Guide](/installation/quickstart-guide), which includes comprehensive instructions for both PowerSync Cloud and self-hosted deployments.

For self-hosted setups, the Quickstart Guide covers:

- Setting up sync bucket storage (MongoDB or Postgres)
- Creating a PowerSync config file
- Running the PowerSync service using Docker
- Connecting to your source database
- Defining basic sync rules
- Setting up the client SDK

## Basic Self-Hosted Setup

Here's a minimal setup to get you started:

```bash
# 1. Create a directory for your config
mkdir powersync-service && cd powersync-service

# 2. Create config.yaml (see example below)
# 3. Run MongoDB for sync bucket storage (if not already running)
docker run -d --name powersync-mongo \
  -p 27017:27017 \
  mongo:7.0 --replSet rs0 --bind_ip_all

# Initialize replica set
docker exec -it powersync-mongo mongosh --eval "rs.initiate()"

# 4. Run PowerSync service
docker run -d \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  --name powersync \
  -v $(pwd)/config.yaml:/config/config.yaml \
  -e POWERSYNC_CONFIG_PATH=/config/config.yaml \
  journeyapps/powersync-service:latest start -r unified
```

**Basic config.yaml structure:**

```yaml
# Database connection (configured in next step)
replication:
  connections:
    - type: postgresql
      uri: postgresql://powersync_role:password@host:5432/database
      sslmode: disable # 'verify-full' (default) or 'verify-ca' or 'disable'

# Sync bucket storage
storage:
  type: mongodb
  uri: mongodb://localhost:27017/powersync

# The port which the PowerSync API server will listen on
port: 8080

# Sync rules (defined in a later step)
sync_rules:
  content: |
    bucket_definitions:
      global:
        data:
          - SELECT * FROM todos

# Settings for client authentication
client_auth:
  # For development, you can use development tokens
  # See the Quickstart Guide for details
