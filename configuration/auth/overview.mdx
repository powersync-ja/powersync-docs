## Client Authentication

PowerSync clients (i.e. apps used by your users that embed the PowerSync Client SDK) authenticate against the server-side [PowerSync Service](/architecture/powersync-service) using [JWTs](https://jwt.io/) (signed tokens).

When you call [`connect()`](/intro/setup-guide#connect-to-powersync-service-instance) on the client-side [PowerSync database](/intro/setup-guide#instantiate-the-powersync-database), you pass a [_backend connector_](/configuration/app-backend/client-side-integration#‘backend-connector’) as an argument to it, in which you define a `fetchCredentials()` function that must return a JWT as well the endpoint URL for the PowerSync Service instance that the client will connect to. See [here](/configuration/app-backend/client-side-integration#example-implementation) for example implementations. Your `fetchCredentials()` function will automatically be called by the PowerSync Client SDK whenever it needs it needs a fresh JWT. 


## Client Authentication Options

### Development & Testing

For a quick way to get up and running during development, you can generate [Development Tokens](/configuration/auth/development-tokens) directly from the [PowerSync Dashboard](https://dashboard.powersync.com/) (PowerSync Cloud) or [locally](/configuration/auth/development-tokens#self-hosted) with a self-hosted setup.

### Proper Authentication Integration (Needed for Production)

**Use Existing JWT from Auth Provider:** Some authentication providers already generate JWTs for users which PowerSync can verify directly — see [Common Authentication Providers](#common-authentication-providers) below. In this scenario, your [`fetchCredentials()` function](#client-authentication) can return the existing JWT from your client-side state.

**Custom Auth Integration: Generate JWTs:** For others, some backend code must be added to your application backend to generate the JWTs needed for PowerSync — see [Custom Authentication](/configuration/auth/custom). In this scenario, your `fetchCredentials()` function should make an API call to your [backend application](/configuration/app-backend/setup) to obtain a JWT.


## Common Authentication Providers

PowerSync supports JWT-based authentication from various providers. The table below shows commonly used authentication providers, their JWKS URLs, and any specific configuration requirements.
