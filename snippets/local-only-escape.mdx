<Tip>
  **Note**: This page assumes you want to use PowerSync to sync your backend database with SQLite in your app. If you only want to use PowerSync to manage your local SQLite database without sync, install the SDK in your app and then refer to our [Local Only](/usage/use-case-examples/offline-only-usage) guide.
