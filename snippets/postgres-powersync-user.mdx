```sql
-- Create a role/user with replication privileges for PowerSync
CREATE ROLE powersync_role WITH REPLICATION LOGIN PASSWORD 'myhighlyrandompassword';
-- Set up permissions for the newly created role
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO powersync_role;  
```

For read-only access, only the `SELECT` privilege is required â€” `INSERT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` can be removed.

To restrict read access to specific tables, explicitly list allowed tables for both the `SELECT` privilege, and for the publication mentioned in the next step (as well as for any other publications that may exist).
