PowerSync is a service and set of client SDKs that keeps backend databases in sync with on-device embedded SQLite databases.

It lets you avoid the complexities of using APIs to move app state [over the network](https://www.powersync.com/blog/escaping-the-network-tarpit), and enables real-time reactive [local-first](/resources/local-first-software) & offline-first apps that remain available even when network connectivity is poor or non-existent.

TODO: 1-pager about PowerSync - possibly combine with the philosophy page.
