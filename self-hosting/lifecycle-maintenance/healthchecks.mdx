title: "Health checks"

## Overview

PowerSync Service provides health check endpoints and configurable probes to help you monitor the health and readiness of your deployment. These checks allow you to catch issues before they impact your users.

## Health Check Endpoints

The following HTTP endpoints are available:

- **Startup Probe:**  
  `GET /probes/startup`  
  - `200` – Service has started up correctly  
  - `400` – Service has **not** yet started

- **Liveness Probe:**  
  `GET /probes/liveness`  
  - `200` – Service is alive  
  - `400` – Service is **not** alive

## Example: Docker Health Checks

A configuration with Docker Compose might look like:

```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "node", "-e", "fetch('http://localhost:${PS_PORT}/probes/liveness').then(r => r.ok ? process.exit(0) : process.exit(1)).catch(() => process.exit(1))"]
  interval: 5s
  timeout: 1s
  retries: 15
```

You can find a complete example in the [self-host-demo app](https://github.com/powersync-ja/self-host-demo/blob/main/services/powersync.yaml).

## Advanced: Configurable Health Check Probes (v1.12.0+)

Starting with version **1.12.0**, PowerSync Service supports configurable health check probes.  
You can now choose between filesystem-based and HTTP-based probes, or use both, via the config file. This is especially useful for environments with restricted I/O.

**Configuration options:**

```yaml
healthcheck:
  probes:
    use_filesystem: true   # Enables filesystem-based health probes (default: true)
    use_http: true         # Enables HTTP-based health probes (default: true)
```

If no `healthcheck` configuration is provided, the service defaults to the previous behavior for backwards compatibility.
