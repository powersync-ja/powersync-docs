<Note>
    Binary data can be accessed in the Sync Streams / Sync Rules, but cannot be used as [parameters](/sync/overview#how-it-works). To sync binary columns/fields to clients, those columns need to be converted to hex or base64 representation using the relevant [functions](/sync/supported-sql#functions).
