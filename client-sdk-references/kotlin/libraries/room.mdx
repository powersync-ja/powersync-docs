<Warning>
Room support is currently in alpha.

While we don't expect any major changes and the library is tested on multiple platforms, it depends on raw tables,
an unstable PowerSync feature.
</Warning>

PowerSync supports the Room database library for Kotlin (Multiplatform).

## Features

When adopting the Room integration for PowerSync:

- PowerSync will use the connection pool of the Room database for efficient queries (avoiding e.g. "database is locked" errors).
- Local writes from Room will update watched PowerSync queries, and they will trigger a CRUD upload.
- Writes from PowerSync (including those made by the sync client) will immediately update your Room flows.

## Installation

PowerSync acts as an addon to your existing Room database, which means that (unlike with most other PowerSync SDKs)
you are still responsible for schema management.
Room requires [raw tables](/usage/use-case-examples/raw-tables), as the views managed by PowerSync are incompatible with
the schema verification when Room opens the database.

To add PowerSync to your Room database,

1. Add a dependency on `com.powersync:core` and `com.powersync:integration-room`.
2. Add a dependency on `androidx.sqlite:sqlite-bundled`: Since PowerSync uses a SQLite extension (which are unsupported on
   the platform SQLite libraries on both Android and iOS), you need to bundle a SQLite with your app.
   On the `RoomDatabase.Builder`, call `setDriver()` with a PowerSync-enabled driver:
    ```Kotlin
    val driver = BundledSQLiteDriver().also {
        it.loadPowerSyncExtension() // Extension method by PowerSync
    }
    
    Room.databaseBuilder(...).setDriver(driver).build()
    ```

## Setup

Because PowerSync syncs into tables that you've created with Room, it needs to know which SQL statements to run for
inserts, updates and deletes.

Let's say you had a table like the following:

```Kotlin
@Entity(tableName = "todos")
data class TodoItem(
    // Note that PowerSync uses textual ids (usually randomly-generated UUIDs)
    @PrimaryKey val id: String
    val description: String
    @ColumnInfo(name="created_by") val authorId: String
)
```

To inform PowerSync about that table, include it as a `RawTable` in the schema:

```Kotlin
val schema = Schema(
    RawTable(
        name = "todos",
        put =
            PendingStatement(
                "INSERT OR REPLACE INTO todos (id, description, created_by) VALUES (?, ?, ?)",
                listOf(
                    PendingStatementParameter.Id,
                    PendingStatementParameter.Column("description"),
                    PendingStatementParameter.Column("created_by"),
                ),
            ),
        delete =
            PendingStatement(
                "DELETE FROM todos WHERE id = ?",
                listOf(PendingStatementParameter.Id),
            ),
    ),
)
```

Here:

- The SQL statements must match the schema created by Room.
- The `RawTable.name` and `PendingStatementParameter.Column` values must match the table and column names of the synced
  table from the PowerSync service, derived from your sync rules.

For more details, see [raw tables](/usage/use-case-examples/raw-tables).

After these steps, you can open your Room database like you normally would. Then, you can use the
following method to obtain  a `PowerSyncDatabase` instance which is backed by Room:

```Kotlin
val schema = Schema(...)
val pool = RoomConnectionPool(yourRoomDatabase, schema)
val powersync = PowerSyncDatabase.opened(
    pool = pool,
    scope = this,
    schema = schema,
    identifier = "databaseName", // Prefer to use the same path/name as your Room database
    logger = Logger,
)
```

The returned `PowerSyncDatabase` behaves just like a regular PowerSync database, meaning that you can call
`connect` to establish a sync connection:

```Kotlin
powersync.connect(
    YourBackendConnector(),
    options = SyncOptions(
        // Raw tables require the new client implementation.
        newClientImplementation = true
    )
)
```

## Usage

To run queries, you can keep defining Room DAOs in the usual way:

```Kotlin
@Dao
interface TodoItemsDao {
    @Insert
    suspend fun create(item: TodoItem)

    @Query("SELECT * FROM todo_item")
    fun watchAll(): Flow<List<TodoItem>>
}

// ...

todoItemsDao.create(TodoItem(
    id = Uuid.random()toHexDashString(),
    title = "My first todo item",
    authorId = currentUserId
))

todoItemsDao.watchAll().collect { items ->
    println("This flow emits events for writes from Room and synced data from PowerSync")
}
```

## Local writes

To transfer local writes from Room to PowerSync:

1. Create triggers on your Room tables to insert rows into `ps_crud`. See [raw tables](/usage/use-case-examples/raw-tables#capture-local-writes-with-triggers) for details.
2. Ensure the `RoomConnectionPool` is constructed with your `schema` (as shown above). When the schema is provided, the pool will notify PowerSync about writes to every raw table referenced in the schema.
3. Alternatively, after performing writes through Room, invoke:

```Kotlin
pool.transferPendingRoomUpdatesToPowerSync()
```

This explicitly transfers any pending Room updates to PowerSync if you prefer to control the timing.
