The [PowerSync Service](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-service) can be self-hosted using Docker. It is published to Docker Hub as [journeyapps/powersync-service](https://hub.docker.com/r/journeyapps/powersync-service).

<Note>
  * The PowerSync Open Edition is currently considered a beta release as it still requires more detailed documentation and guides.
  * From a stability perspective the Open Edition is production-ready as it uses the same codebase as our Cloud version.
  * Note that the [PowerSync Dashboard](https://dashboard.powersync.com/) is currently not available in the PowerSync Open Edition.
  * Please reach out on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/powersync) if you have any questions not yet covered in these docs.
