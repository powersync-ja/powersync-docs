title: "CRDTs"
description: "While PowerSync does not use [CRDTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free%5Freplicated%5Fdata%5Ftype) directly as part of its sync or conflict resolution process, CRDT data (from a library such as [Yjs](https://github.com/yjs/yjs) or y-crdt) may be persisted and synced using PowerSync."
---

This may be useful for cases such as document editing, where last-write-wins is not sufficient for conflict resolution. PowerSync becomes the provider for CRDT data â€” both for local storage and for propagating changes to other clients.

### Example Implementations

For an example implementation, refer to the following demo built using the PowerSync JavaScript Web SDK:
