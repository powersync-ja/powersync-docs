description: "Manage your PowerSync Cloud environment programmatically"

You can use the [PowerSync CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/powersync) to manage your PowerSync Cloud instances from your machine. Specifically, you can:

* Manage your [PowerSync instances ](/architecture/powersync-service)(PowerSync Cloud)
* Validate and deploy [Sync Rules](/sync/rules/overview) to an instance from a local file
* Generate the [client-side schema](/installation/client-side-setup/define-your-schema)

<Note>
  The PowerSync CLI is not yet compatible with managing [self-hosted](/self-hosting/introduction) PowerSync instances (PowerSync Open Edition and PowerSync Enterprise Self-Hosted Edition). This is on our roadmap.
</Note>

### Getting started

To begin, initialize the CLI via `npx`:

```bash
npx powersync init
```

### Personal Access Token

```bash
npx powersync init

? Enter your API token: [hidden]
```

You need to provide an access (API) token to initialize the CLI. These can be created in your [Account Settings](https://dashboard.powersync.com/account/access-tokens) in the PowerSync Dashboard.

Here you can also revoke access by deleting the token.

### Deploying Sync Rules with GitHub Actions

You can automate sync rule deployments using the PowerSync CLI in your CI/CD pipeline. This is useful for ensuring your sync rules are automatically deployed whenever changes are pushed to a repository.

</Card>

The example repository demonstrates how to:
* Set up a GitHub Actions workflow to deploy sync rules on push to the `main` branch
* Configure required repository secrets (`POWERSYNC_AUTH_TOKEN`, `POWERSYNC_INSTANCE_ID`, `POWERSYNC_PROJECT_ID`, `POWERSYNC_ORG_ID`)
* Automatically deploy `sync-rules.yaml` changes

### Known issues and limitations

* Certificates cannot currently be managed from the CLI.
* The PowerSync CLI is not yet compatible with managing [self-hosted](/self-hosting/introduction) PowerSync instances (PowerSync Open Edition and PowerSync Enterprise Self-Hosted Edition). This is on our roadmap.
