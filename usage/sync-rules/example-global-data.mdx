title: "Global Data"
description: 'The simplest approach is for "global" data â€” synced to all users. '
---

For example, the following configuration syncs all `todos` and only unarchived `lists` to all users:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Sync Streams">
    ```yaml
    config:
      edition: 2
    streams:
      all_todos:
        query: SELECT * FROM todos
        auto_subscribe: true 
      unarchived_lists:
        query: SELECT * FROM lists WHERE archived = false
        auto_subscribe: true
    ```
    
    <Info>
      With Sync Streams, "global" data is defined as streams with `auto_subscribe: true`, so users subscribe to them by default.
    </Info>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Sync Rules (legacy)">
    ```yaml
    bucket_definitions:
      global_bucket:
        data:
          # Sync all todos
          - SELECT * FROM todos
          # Sync all lists except archived ones
          - SELECT * FROM lists WHERE archived = false
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

  **Note**: Table names must match the names defined in the [client-side schema](/installation/client-side-setup/define-your-schema).
