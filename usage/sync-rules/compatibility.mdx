description: "Configure sync behavior: enable latest backwards-incompatible fixes (recommended for new projects) or keep legacy behavior."
---

To ensure consistency, it is important that the PowerSync Service does not interpret the same source row in different ways after updating to a new version.
At the same time, we want to fix bugs or other inaccuracies that have accumulated during the development of the Service.

## Overview

To make this trade‑off explicit, you choose whether to keep the existing behavior or turn on newer fixes that slightly change how data is processed.

Use the `config` block in your Sync Rules YAML file to choose the behavior. There are two ways to turn fixes on:

1. Set an `edition` to enable the full set of fixes for that edition. This is the recommended approach for new projects.
2. Toggle individual options for more fine‑grained control.

For older projects, the previous behavior remains the default. New projects should enable all current fixes.

### Configuration

For new projects, it is recommended to enable all current fixes by setting `edition: <edition>`:

```yaml sync_rules.yaml
config:
  edition: 2 # Recommended to set to the latest available edition (see 'Supported fixes' table below)

bucket_definitions:
  # ...
```

Or, specify options individually:

```yaml sync_rules.yaml
config:
  timestamps_iso8601: true
  versioned_bucket_ids: true
  fixed_json_extract: true
  custom_postgres_types: true
```

## Supported fixes

This table lists all fixes currently supported:

### `timestamps_iso8601`

PowerSync is supposed to encode timestamps according to the ISO-8601 standard.
Without this fix, the service encoded timestamps from MongoDB and Postgres source databases incorrectly.
To ensure time values from Postgres compare lexicographically, they're also padded to six digits of accuracy when encoded.
Since MongoDB only stores values with an accuracy of milliseconds, only three digits of accuracy are used.

For instance, the value `2025-09-22T14:29:30` would be encoded as follows:

- For Postgres: `2025-09-22 14:29:30` without the fix, `2025-09-22T14:29:30.000000` with the fix applied.
- For MongoDB: `2025-09-22 14:29:30.000` without the fix, `2025-09-22T14:29:30.000` with the fix applied.

Note that MySQL has never been affected by this issue, and thus behaves the same regardless of the option used.

### `versioned_bucket_ids`

Sync Rules define buckets, which rows to sync are then assigned to. When you run a full defragmentation or
redeploy Sync Rules, the same bucket identifiers are re-used when processing data again.

Because the second iteration uses different checksums for the same bucket ids, clients may sync data
twice before realizing that something is off and starting from scratch.

Applying this fix improves client-side progress estimation and is more efficient, since data would not get
downloaded twice.

### `fixed_json_extract`

This fixes the `json_extract` functions as well as the `->` and `->>` operators in sync rules to behave similar
to recent SQLite versions: We only split on `.` if the path starts with `$.`.

For instance, `'json_extract({"foo.bar": "baz"}', 'foo.bar')` would evaluate to:

1. `baz` with the option enabled.
2. `null` with the option disabled.

### `custom_postgres_types`

If you have custom Postgres types in your backend database schema, older versions of the PowerSync Service
would not recognize these values and sync them with the textual wire representation used by Postgres.
This is especially noticeable when defining `DOMAIN` types with e.g. a `REAL` inner type: The wrapped
`DOMAIN` type should get synced as a real value as well, but it would actually get synced as a string.

With this fix applied:

- `DOMAIN TYPE`s are synced as their inner type.
- Array types of custom types get parsed correctly, and sync as a JSON array.
- Custom types get parsed and synced as a JSON object containing their members.
- Ranges sync as a JSON object corresponding to the following TypeScript definition:
  ```TypeScript
  export type Range<T> =
    | {
        lower: T | null;
        upper: T | null;
        lower_exclusive: boolean;
        upper_exclusive: boolean;
        }
    | 'empty';
  ```
- Multi-ranges sync as an array of ranges.
