title: "Development Tokens"
---

PowerSync allows generating temporary development tokens for authentication. 

This is useful for developers who want to get up and running quickly, without a full custom auth implementation. 
This may also be used to generate a token for a specific user to debug issues.

## Generating a Development Token

import GenerateDevelopmentToken from '/snippets/generate-development-token.mdx';

<GenerateDevelopmentToken />

## Usage

Development tokens can be used either with the [Sync Diagnostics Client](https://diagnostics-app.powersync.com) or the [test-client](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-service/tree/main/test-client).

### Using with Sync Diagnostics Client

The [Sync Diagnostics Client](https://diagnostics-app.powersync.com) allows you to quickly inspect a user's local database and verify that your PowerSync Service configuration and Sync Rules behave as expected.

1. Open the [Sync Diagnostics Client](https://diagnostics-app.powersync.com)
2. Enter your PowerSync Service endpoint
3. Enter the generated development token
4. Inspect the synced data in SQLite

### Using with Your Application

To use the temporary development token in your application, update the `fetchCredentials()` function in your backend connector to return the generated token (see [Integrate with your Backend](/installation/client-side-setup/integrating-with-your-backend) for more information).

Example:

```js
return PowerSyncCredentials(
        endpoint: AppConfig.powersyncUrl,
        token: 'temp-token-here');
```
