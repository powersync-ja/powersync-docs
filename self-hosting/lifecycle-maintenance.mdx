## Migrations

Migrations run automatically by default.

```yaml
# powersync.yaml

migrations:
    # Setting this to true will skip automatic migrations.
    # Migrations can be triggered externally by altering the container `command`.
    disable_auto_migration: true
```
MongoDB locks are used to ensure that migrations are only executed once in the case where multiple containers can be started simultaneously.

## Backups

We recommend using git to backup your configuration files.

Your MongoDB database (for sync bucket storage) does not need to be backed up since it's easily recreated from Postgres.
