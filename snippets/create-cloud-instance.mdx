1. In the **Overview** workspace of the [PowerSync Dashboard](/usage/tools/powersync-dashboard) you will be prompted to create your first instance:
  <Frame>
    <img src="/images/installation/overview-create-instance.png" />
  </Frame>
  <Note>
    If you previously created an instance, you can create a secondary instance by navigating to the **Manage instances** workspace and clicking on **Create new instance**.
    <img src="/images/installation/create-new-instance.png" width="40%" />
  </Note>
2. Give your instance a name, such as "Testing".
