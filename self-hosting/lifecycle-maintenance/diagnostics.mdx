description: "How to use the PowerSync service Diagnostics API"
---

All self-hosted PowerSync service instances ship with a diagnostics API.
This API provides the following diagnostic information:

- Connections → Connected source backend database and any active errors associated with the connection.
- Active Sync Rules → Currently deployed sync rules and the status of the sync rules.

# Configuration

1. To enable the Diagnostics API, specify an API token in your PowerSync YAML file:

```yaml powersync.yaml
api:
  tokens:
    - YOUR_API_TOKEN
```
<Warning>Make sure to use a secure API token as part of this configuration</Warning>

2. Restart the PowerSync service.

3. Once configured, send an HTTP request to your PowerSync service diagnostics API endpoint. Include the API token set in step 1 as a Bearer token in the Authorization header.

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/admin/v1/diagnostics \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```
