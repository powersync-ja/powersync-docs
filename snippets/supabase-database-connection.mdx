1. Copy the database connection details from Supabase:
   * In your Supabase dashboard, navigate to **"Project Settings"** \-> **"Database" -> "Connection string**" and select the "URI" tab.
   * Uncheck the "**Display connection pooler**" checkbox. PowerSync needs to connect to the database directly and cannot use the pooler.

    </Frame>
   * Copy the connection string. The hostname should be `db.<PROJECT-ID>.supabase.co`, and not, for example, `aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com`.
   * Paste this URI in PowerSync instance **URI** field.
   * Enter the **Password** for the `postgres` user in your Supabase database.
     * Supabase also [refers to this password](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/managing-passwords) as the _database password_ or _project password_.
   * PowerSync has the Supabase CA certificate pre-configured â€” `verify-full` SSL mode can be used directly, without any custom certificates.
2. Click **"Test Connection"** and fix any errors.
3. Under the **"Client Auth"** tab, enable **"Use Supabase Auth"**:

4. Click **"Save".**

<Note>
The "Supabase Auth" setting no longer works for Supabase projects created after 25 November 2024. While we are working with Supabase on a fix, please apply this workaround: https://releases.powersync.com/announcements/important-notice-for-supabase-users-using-supabase-jwts

PowerSync deploys and configures an isolated cloud environment for you, which will take a few minutes to complete.
