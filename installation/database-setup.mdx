# Database Configuration Guide

## <Icon icon="elephant" iconType="solid" size="24" /> Postgres Setup

<Info>
  PowerSync supports multiple database backends. This section covers Postgres configuration. See below for MongoDB and MySQL setup instructions.
</Info>

<Check>
  **Version Requirement**: PowerSync requires Postgres version 11 or greater.
</Check>

### Key Configuration Steps

Setting up Postgres with PowerSync involves three essential tasks:

1. Enabling logical replication
2. Creating a PowerSync database user
3. Creating the `powersync` publication

<Note>
  These steps may vary slightly depending on your hosting provider. We've provided detailed instructions for popular hosting platforms below.
</Note>

### Provider-Specific Setup Instructions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Supabase">
    #### 1. Logical Replication Setup
    
    <Check>Supabase has logical replication enabled by default — no action required.</Check>

    #### 2. PowerSync User Creation

    <Warning>
      Creating a new user with replication permissions requires Supabase support assistance. Use the default `postgres` user as a workaround.
    </Warning>

    #### 3. Publication Creation

    <Note>
      The `postgres` user has limited publication permissions. You must explicitly list tables in the publication.
    </Note>

    ```sql
    CREATE PUBLICATION powersync FOR TABLE public.lists, public.todos;
    ```

    <Tip>
      This can also be configured through the Supabase dashboard under the database *Replication* page.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="AWS RDS">
    #### Prerequisites

    <Warning>
      The instance must be publicly accessible using an IPv4 address.
    </Warning>

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/setup-1.avif" />
    </Frame>

    <Note>
      For security, access can be restricted to specific IPs — see [IP Filtering](/installation/database-setup/security-and-ip-filtering).
    </Note>

    #### 1. Logical Replication Setup

    Enable logical replication in your parameter group:

    1. Navigate to RDS parameter groups
    2. Set `rds.logical_replication` to `1`

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/setup-2.png" />
    </Frame>

    #### 2. PowerSync User Creation

    Execute the following SQL commands:

    ```sql
    -- Create PowerSync user
    CREATE ROLE powersync_role WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'myhighlyrandompassword';

    -- Grant replication permissions
    GRANT rds_replication TO powersync_role;

    -- Set up access permissions
    GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO powersync_role;
    ```

    <Note>
      For read-only access, only `SELECT` privilege is needed. Remove `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` as needed.
    </Note>

    #### 3. Publication Creation

    ```sql
    -- Create publication for all tables
    CREATE PUBLICATION powersync FOR ALL TABLES;
    ```

    <Warning>
      The publication must be named "powersync" exactly.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

### Unsupported Postgres Providers

<Warning>
  Not all hosting providers support PowerSync due to logical replication requirements. 
</Warning>

<Note>
  Some "serverless Postgres" providers don't support logical replication and are therefore incompatible with PowerSync.
</Note>

## <Icon icon="leaf" iconType="solid" size="24" /> MongoDB Setup (Beta)

<Check>
  **Version Requirement**: PowerSync requires MongoDB version 6.0 or greater.
</Check>

### MongoDB Support Status

#### Beta Release (December 2024)

<Info>
  Our MongoDB connector is now in Beta and ready for production use with adequate testing. See our [full release notes](https://releases.powersync.com/announcements/mongodb-as-a-backend-database-now-in-beta).
</Info>

#### V1 Development (ETA 2025Q1)

Our V1 roadmap focuses on:
- Enhanced usability features
- Improved documentation and migration guides
- Reference/demo applications
- Potential support for sharded clusters

### Required Permissions

#### MongoDB Atlas

Basic permissions required:
```
readWrite@<your_database>._powersync_checkpoints
read@<your_database>
```

For automatic `changeStreamPreAndPostImages` configuration:
```
readWrite@<your_database>._powersync_checkpoints
read@<your_database>
dbAdmin@<your_database>
```

<Note>
  For multi-database replication, add: `readAnyDatabase@admin`
</Note>
