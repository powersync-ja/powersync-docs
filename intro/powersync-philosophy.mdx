### What PowerSync means for end-users

The app just works, whether fully online, fully offline, or with spotty connectivity.

The app is always [fast and responsive](https://www.powersync.com/blog/local-first-is-a-big-deal-especially-for-the-web#to-the-user-everything-feels-instant-no-loading-spinners) — no need to wait for network requests.

### What PowerSync means for the developer

PowerSync lets you avoid the complexities of using APIs to move app state [over the network](https://www.powersync.com/blog/escaping-the-network-tarpit). Its goal is to solve the hard problems of keeping data in sync, without getting in your way.

You use a standard Postgres, MongoDB or MySQL \[[1](#footnotes)\] database on the server, a standard SQLite database on the client, and your [own backend](/installation/app-backend-setup) to process writes. PowerSync simply keeps the SQLite database in sync with your backend/server database.

#### State Management

Once you have a local SQLite database that is always in sync, [state management](https://www.powersync.com/blog/local-first-state-management-with-sqlite) becomes much easier:

* No need for custom caching logic, whether in-memory or persisted.
* No need for maintaining in-memory state across the application.

[All state is in the local database](https://www.powersync.com/blog/local-first-state-management-with-sqlite). Queries are reactive — updating whenever the underlying data changes.

#### Flexibility

PowerSync allows you to fully customize what data is synced to the client. Syncing the entire database is extremely simple, but it is just as easy to use our [Sync Rules](/usage/sync-rules) to transform and filter data for each client (dynamic partial replication).

Writing back to the backend database [is in full control of the developer](/installation/app-backend-setup/writing-client-changes) — use your own authentication, validation, and constraints.

Our goal is also to be stack-agnostic: whether you are switching from MySQL to Postgres, from Flutter to React Native, or using multiple different stacks — our aim is to maintain maximum engineering optionality for developers.

#### Performance

[SQLite is _fast_](https://www.powersync.com/blog/sqlite-optimizations-for-ultra-high-performance). It can perform tens of thousands of updates per second, even faster reads, with seamless support for concurrent reads. Once you get to filtering through thousands of rows in queries, [indexes](/installation/client-side-setup/define-your-schema) keep the queries fast.

#### Simplicity

You use plain Postgres, MongoDB or MySQL on the server — no extensions, and no significant change in your schema required \[[2](#footnotes)\]. PowerSync [uses](/installation/database-setup) Postgres logical replication, MongoDB change streams or the MySQL binlog to replicate changes to the [PowerSync Service](/architecture/powersync-service), where data is transformed and partitioned according to [Sync Rules](/usage/sync-rules), and persisted in a way that allows efficiently streaming incremental changes to each client.

PowerSync has been used in apps with hundreds of tables. There are no complex migrations to run: You define your [Sync Rules](/usage/sync-rules) and [client-side schema](/installation/client-side-setup/define-your-schema), and the data is automatically kept in sync. If you [change Sync Rules](/usage/lifecycle-maintenance/implementing-schema-changes), the entire new set of data is applied atomically on the client. When you do need to make schema changes on the server while still supporting older clients, we [have the processes in place](/usage/lifecycle-maintenance/implementing-schema-changes) to do that without hassle.

No need for CRDTs \[3\]. PowerSync is a server-client sync platform: since no peer-to-peer syncing is involved, CRDTs can be overkill. Instead, we use a server reconciliation architecture with a default approach of "last write wins", with capability to [customize the conflict resolution if required](/usage/lifecycle-maintenance/handling-update-conflicts) — the developer is in [full control of the write process](/installation/app-backend-setup/writing-client-changes). Our [strong consistency guarantees](/architecture/consistency) give you peace of mind for the integrity of data on the client.
