title: "Compacting Buckets"
description: "[Buckets](/usage/sync-rules/organize-data-into-buckets) store data as a history of changes, not only the current state."

This allows clients to download incremental changes efficiently — only changed rows have to be downloaded. However, over time this history can grow large, causing new clients to potentially take a long time to download the initial set of data. To handle this, we compact the history of each bucket.

## Compacting

### PowerSync Cloud

The cloud-hosted version of PowerSync will automatically compact all buckets once per day.

Support to manually trigger compacting is available in the [Dashboard](/usage/tools/powersync-dashboard): Right-click on an instance, or search for the action using the [Command Palette](/usage/tools/powersync-dashboard#the-command-palette). Support to trigger compacting from the [CLI](/usage/tools/cli) will be added soon.

[Defragmenting](/usage/lifecycle-maintenance/compacting-buckets#defragmenting) may still be required.

### Self-hosted PowerSync

For self-hosted setups (PowerSync Open Edition & PowerSync Enterprise Self-Hosted Edition), the `compact` command in the Docker image can be used to compact all buckets. This can be run manually, or on a regular schedule using Kubernetes [CronJob](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/) or similar scheduling functionality.

[Defragmenting](/usage/lifecycle-maintenance/compacting-buckets#defragmenting) may still be required.

## Background

### Bucket operations

Each bucket is an ordered list of `PUT`, `REMOVE`, `MOVE` and `CLEAR` operations. In normal operation, only `PUT` and `REMOVE` operations are created.

A simplified view of a bucket may look like this:

```bash
(1, PUT, row1, <data>)
(2, PUT, row2, <data>)
(3, PUT, row1, <data>)
(4, REMOVE, row2)
```

### Compacting step 1 - MOVE operations

The first step of compacting involves `MOVE` operations. This just indicates that an operation is not needed anymore, since a later `PUT` or `REMOVE` operation replaces the row.

After this compact step, the bucket may look like this:

```bash
(1, MOVE)
(2, MOVE)
(3, PUT, row1, <data>)
(4, REMOVE, row2)
```

This does not reduce the number of operations to download, but can reduce the amount of data to download.

### Compacting step 2 - CLEAR operations

The second step of compacting takes a sequence of `CLEAR`, `MOVE` and/or `REMOVE` operations at the start of the bucket, and replaces them all with a single `CLEAR` operation. The `CLEAR` operation indicates to the client that "this is the start of the bucket, delete any prior operations that you may have".

After this compacting step, the bucket may look like this:

```bash
(2, CLEAR)
(3, PUT, row1, <data>)
(4, REMOVE, row2)
```

This reduces the number of operations for new clients to download in some cases.

The `CLEAR` operation can only remove operations at the start of the bucket, not in the middle of the bucket, which leads us to the next step.

### Defragmenting

There are cases that the above compacting steps cannot optimize efficiently. Imagine this sequence of statements:

```bash
-- Insert a single row
INSERT INTO lists(name) VALUES('a');
-- Insert 50k rows
INSERT INTO lists (name) SELECT 'b' FROM generate_series(1, 50000);
-- Delete those 50k rows, but keep 'a'
DELETE FROM lists WHERE name = 'b';
```

After compacting, the bucket looks like this:


```bash
(1, PUT, row_1, <data>)
(2, MOVE)
(3, MOVE)
...
(50001, MOVE)
(50002, REMOVE, row2)
(50003, REMOVE, row3)
...
(100001, REMOVE, row50000)
```

This is inefficient, since we have over 100k operations for downloading a single actual row.

To handle this case, we "defragment" the bucket by updating existing rows in the source database. In this case, we can run:

```bash
-- Touch all rows
UPDATE lists SET name = name;
-- OR touch specific rows at the start of the bucket
UPDATE lists SET name = name WHERE name = 'a';
```

This creates a new PUT operation at the end of the bucket, which allows the compact steps to efficiently compact the bucket:

```bash
(100001, CLEAR)
(100002, PUT, row_1, <data>)
```

The bucket is now back to two operations, allowing new clients to sync efficiently.

### Defragmenting trade-offs

Defragmenting + compacting as described above can significantly reduce the number of operations in a bucket, at the cost of existing clients needing to re-sync that data. When and how to do this depends on the specific use-case and data update patterns.

One approach is to have regular partial defragmentation, using a query such as:

```bash
UPDATE lists SET updated_at = now() WHERE updated_at < now() - interval '1 week'
```

This can be performed on a regular schedule such as every hour or every day, using [pg\_cron](https://github.com/citusdata/pg%5Fcron) or backend-level scheduled tasks.

The above example will cause clients to re-sync each row once a week, while preventing the number of operations from growing indefinitely. Depending on how often rows in the bucket are modified, the interval can be increased or decreased.

## Sync Rule deployments

Whenever modifications to [Sync Rules](/usage/sync-rules) are deployed, all buckets are re-created from scratch. This has a similar effect to fully defragmenting and compacting all buckets. This was recommended as a workaround before explicit compacting became available ([released July 26, 2024](https://releases.powersync.com/announcements/bucket-compacting)).

In the future, we may use [incremental sync rule reprocessing](https://roadmap.powersync.com/c/85-more-efficient-sync-reprocessing) to process changed bucket definitions only.
