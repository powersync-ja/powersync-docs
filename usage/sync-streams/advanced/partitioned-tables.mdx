title: "Partitioned Tables (Postgres)"
description: "Partitioned tables and wildcard table name matching"
---

For partitioned tables in Postgres, each individual partition is replicated and processed using Sync Streams.

To use the same queries and same output table name for each partition, use `%` for wildcard suffix matching of the table name:
```yaml
streams:
  by_user:
    # Use wildcard in a stream query
    query: SELECT * FROM "todos_%" AS todos WHERE user_id = auth.user_id()
```

The wildcard character can only be used as the last character in the table name.

When using wildcard table names, the original table suffix is available in the special `_table_suffix` column:

```sql
SELECT * FROM "todos_%" AS todos WHERE _table_suffix != 'archived'
```

When no table alias is provided, the original table name is preserved.

`publish_via_partition_root` on the publication is not supported â€” the individual partitions must be published.
