title: "Sync Streams (Early Alpha)"
description: Sync Streams will replace Sync Rules and are designed to allow for more dynamic syncing.
---

## Motivation

PowerSync's original [Sync Rules](/usage/sync-rules) system was optimized for offline-first use cases where you want to “sync everything upfront” when the client connects, so that data is available locally if a user goes offline at any point.

However, many developers are building apps where users are mostly online, and you don't want to make users wait to sync a lot of data upfront. In these cases, it's more suited to sync data on-demand. This is especially true for web apps: users are mostly online and you often want to sync only the data needed for the current page. Users also frequently have multiple tabs open, each needing different subsets of data.

Sync engines like PowerSync are still great for these online web app use cases, because they provide you with real-time updates, simplified state management, and ease of working with data locally.

[Client Parameters](/usage/sync-rules/advanced-topics/client-parameters) in the current Sync Rules system support on-demand syncing across different browser tabs to some extent: For example, using a `project_ids` array as a Client Parameter to sync only specific projects. However, manually managing these arrays across different browser tabs becomes quite painful.

We are introducing **Sync Streams** to provide the best of both worlds: support for dynamic on-demand syncing, as well as "syncing everything upfront".

Key improvements in Sync Streams over Sync Rules include:

1. **On-demand syncing**: You define Sync Streams on the PowerSync Service, and a client can then subscribe to them one or more times with different parameters.
2. **Temporary caching-like behavior**: Each subscription includes a configurable `ttl` that keeps data active after your app unsubscribes, acting as a warm cache for recently accessed data.
3. **Simpler developer experience**: Simplified syntax and mental model, and capabilities such as your UI components automatically managing subscriptions (for example, React hooks).

If you want “sync everything upfront” behavior (like the current Sync Rules system), that’s easy too: you can configure any of your Sync Streams to be auto-subscribed by the client on connecting.


<Warning>
## Early Alpha Release

Sync Streams will ultimately replace the current Sync Rules system. They are currently in an early alpha release, which of course means they're not yet suitable for production use, and the APIs and DX likely still need refinement. 

They are open for anyone to test: we are actively seeking your feedback on their performance for your use cases, the developer experience, missing capabilities, and potential optimizations. Please share your feedback with us in Discord 🫡

Sync Streams will be supported alongside Sync Rules for the foreseeable future, although we recommend migrating to Sync Streams once in Beta.

* Sync Stream definitions. They are currently defined in the same YAML file as Sync Rules: `sync_rules.yaml` (PowerSync Cloud) or `config.yaml` (Open Edition/self-hosted). To enable Sync Streams, add the following configuration:
  
  ```yaml sync_rules.yaml
  # see https://docs.powersync.com/usage/sync-rules/compatibility#overview
  config:
    edition: 2

  streams:
    ... # see 'Stream Definition Syntax' section below
  ```

## Stream Definition Syntax

You specify **stream definitions** similar to bucket definitions in Sync Rules. Clients then subscribe to the defined streams one or more times, with different parameters.

Syntax:
```yaml sync_rules.yaml
streams:
  <stream_name>:
    query: string # similar to Data Queries in Sync Rules, but also support limited subqueries.
    auto_subscribe: boolean # true to subscribe to this stream by default (similar to how Sync Rules work), false (default) if clients should explicitly subscribe.
    priority: number # sync priority, same as in Sync Rules: https://docs.powersync.com/usage/use-case-examples/prioritized-sync
    accept_potentially_dangerous_queries: boolean # silence warnings on dangerous queries, same as in Sync Rules.
```

Basic example:
```yaml sync_rules.yaml
config:
  edition: 2
streams:
  issue: # Define a stream to a specific issue
    query: select * from issues where id = subscription.parameters() ->> 'id' 
  issue_comments: # Define a stream to a specific issue's comments
    query: select * from comments where issue_id = subscription.parameters() ->> 'id' 

```


### Just Queries with Subqueries

Whereas Sync Rules had separate [Parameter Queries](/usage/sync-rules/parameter-queries) and [Data Queries](/usage/sync-rules/data-queries), Sync Streams only have a `query`. Instead of Parameter Queries, Sync Streams can use parameters directly in the query, and support a limited form of subqueries. For example:

```yaml sync_rules.yaml
# use parameters directly in the query (see below for details on accessing parameters)
select * from issues where id = subscription.parameters() ->> 'id' and owner_id = auth.user_id()

# "in (subquery)" replaces parameter queries:
select * from comments where issue_id in (select id from issues where owner_id = auth.user_id())
```

Under the hood, Sync Streams use the same bucket system as Sync Rules, so you get the same functionality as before with Parameter Queries, however, the Sync Streams syntax is closer to plain SQL.


### Accessing Parameters

We have streamlined how different kinds of parameters are accessed in Sync Streams [compared](/usage/sync-rules/parameter-queries) to Sync Rules.

Both auth parameters (extracted from the JWT) and connection parameters (also called [client parameters](/usage/sync-rules/advanced-topics/client-parameters) in sync rules)
can be queried with the `.parameter('name')` function to extract a single one or with `.parameters()` to get all of them
as a JSON object.
Additionally, sync streams support per-stream parameters (and clients can subscribe to the same stream multiple times with
different parameters):

**Subscription Parameters**: Passed from the client when it subscribes to a Sync Stream:

```yaml
subscription.parameters() # all parameters for the specific subscription, as JSON
subscription.parameter('key') # shorthand for getting a specific parameter
```

**Auth Parameters**: Claims from the JWT:

```yaml
auth.parameters() # JWT token payload, as JSON
auth.parameter('key') # short-hand for getting a specific token payload parameter
auth.user_id() # same as auth.parameter('sub')
```


**Connection Parameters**: Specified "globally" on the connection level. These are the equivalent of Client Parameters in Sync Rules:

```yaml
connection.parameters() # all parameters for the connection, as JSON
connection.parameter('key') # shorthand for getting a specific connection parameter
```

### Usage Examples: Sync Rules vs Sync Streams

<Expandable title="Examples">

### Global data
**Sync Rules:**
```yaml sync_rules.yaml
  bucket_definitions:
    global:
        data:
        # Sync all todos
        - SELECT * FROM todos
        # Sync all lists except archived ones
        - SELECT * FROM lists WHERE archived = false
```
**Sync Streams:** "Global" data — the data you want all of your users to have by default — is also defined as streams. Specify `auto_subscribe: true` so your users subscribe to them by default.
```yaml sync_rules.yaml
  streams:
    all_todos:
        query: SELECT * FROM todos
        auto_subscribe: true 
    unarchived_lists:
        query: SELECT * FROM lists WHERE archived = false
        auto_subscribe: true     

```

### A user's owned lists, with a priority
**Sync Rules:**
```yaml sync_rules.yaml
  bucket_definitions:
    user_lists:
        priority: 1 # See https://docs.powersync.com/usage/use-case-examples/prioritized-sync  
        parameters: SELECT request.user_id() as user_id
        data:
        - SELECT * FROM lists WHERE owner_id = bucket.user_id
```

**Sync Streams:** 
```yaml sync_rules.yaml
  streams:
    user_lists:
        priority: 1 # See https://docs.powersync.com/usage/use-case-examples/prioritized-sync  
        query: SELECT * FROM lists WHERE owner_id = auth.user_id()
```

### Grouping by `list_id`
**Sync Rules:**
```yaml sync_rules.yaml
  bucket_definitions:
    owned_lists:
        parameters: |
            SELECT id as list_id FROM lists WHERE
            owner_id = request.user_id()
        data:
        - SELECT * FROM lists WHERE lists.id = bucket.list_id
        - SELECT * FROM todos WHERE todos.list_id = bucket.list_id
```
**Sync Streams:** 
```yaml sync_rules.yaml
  streams:
    owned_lists:
        query: SELECT * FROM lists WHERE owner_id = auth.user_id()
    list_todos:
        query: SELECT * FROM todos WHERE list_id = subscription.parameter('list_id') AND list_id IN (SELECT id FROM lists WHERE owner_id = auth.user_id())
 
```

### Parameters usage
**Sync Rules:**
```yaml sync_rules.yaml
  bucket_definitions:
    posts:
        parameters: SELECT (request.parameters() ->> 'current_page') as page_number
        data:
        - SELECT * FROM posts WHERE page_number = bucket.page_number
```
**Sync Streams:** 
```yaml sync_rules.yaml
  streams:
    posts:
        query: SELECT * FROM posts WHERE page_number = subscription.parameter('page_number')
```
Note that the behavior here is different to Sync Rules because `subscription.parameter('page_number')` is local to the subscription, so the Sync Stream can be subscribed to multiple times with different page numbers, whereas Sync Rules only allow a single global Client Parameter value at a time. Connection Parameters (`connection.parameter()`) are available in Sync Streams as the equivalent of the global Client Parameters in Sync Rules, but Subscription Parameters are recommended because they are much more flexible.

### Specific columns/fields, renames and transformations

Selecting, renaming or transforming specific columns/fields is identical between Sync Rules and Sync Streams:

```yaml sync_rules.yaml
  streams:
    todos:
        # Select specific columns
        query: SELECT id, name, owner_id FROM todos 
        # Rename columns
        query: SELECT id, name, created_timestamp AS created_at FROM todos 
        # Cast number to text
        query: SELECT id, item_number :: text AS item_number FROM todos
        # Alternative syntax for the same cast
        query: id, CAST(item_number as TEXT) AS item_number FROM todos
        # Convert binary data (bytea) to base64
        query: id, base64(thumbnail) AS thumbnail_base64 FROM todos
        # Extract field from JSON or JSONB column
        query: id, metadata_json ->> 'description' AS description FROM todos
        # Convert time to epoch number
        query: id, unixepoch(created_at) AS created_at FROM todos
```
</Expandable>


## Client-Side Syntax

In general, each SDK lets you:

* Use `db.syncStream(name, [subscription-params])` to get a `SyncStream` instance.
* Call `subscribe()` on a `SyncStream` to get a `SyncStreamSubscription`. This gives you access to `waitForFirstSync()` and `unsubscribe()`.
* Inspect `SyncStatus` for a list of `SyncSubscriptionDefinition`s describing all Sync Streams your app is subscribed to (either due to an explicit subscription or because the Sync Stream has `auto_subscribe: true`). It also reports per-stream download progress.
* Each Sync Stream has a `ttl` (time-to-live). After you call `unsubscribe()`, or when the page/app closes, the stream keeps syncing for the `ttl` duration, enabling caching-like behavior. Each SDK lets you specify the `ttl`, or ignore the `ttl` and delete the data as soon as possible. If not specified, a default TTL of 24h applies.

    <Tab title="JS">
    ```js
    const sub = await powerSync.syncStream('issues', {id: 'issue-id'}).subscribe(ttl: 3600);

    // Resolve current status for subscription
    const status = powerSync.currentStatus.forStream(sub);
    const progress = status?.progress;

    // Wait for this subscription to have synced
    await sub.waitForFirstSync();

    // When the component needing the subscription is no longer active...
    sub.unsubscribe();
    ```

    If you're using React, you can also use hooks to automatically subscribe components to sync streams:

    ```js
    const stream = useSyncStream({ name: 'todo_list', parameters: { list: 'foo' } });
    // Can then check for download progress or subscription information
    stream?.progress;
    stream?.subscription.hasSynced;
    ```

    Additionally, the `useQuery` hook for React can wait for sync streams to be complete before running
    queries:

    ```js
    const results = useQuery(
      'SELECT ...',
      queryParameters,
      // This will wait for the stream to sync before running the query
      { streams: [{ name: 'todo_list', parameters: { list: 'foo' }, waitForStream: true }] }
    );
    ```

    final status = db.currentStatus.forStream(sub);
    final progress = status?.progress;

    // Wait for this subscription to have synced
    await sub.waitForFirstSync();

    // When the component needing the subscription is no longer active...
    sub.unsubscribe();
    ```

    val sub = database.syncStream("issues", mapOf("id" to JsonParam.String("issue-id"))).subscribe(ttl = 1.0.hours);

    // Resolve current status for subscription
    val status = database.currentStatus.forStream(sub)
    val progress = status?.progress

    // Wait for this subscription to have synced
    sub.waitForFirstSync()

    // When the component needing the subscription is no longer active...
    sub.unsubscribe()
    ```

    If you're using Compose, you can use the `composeSyncStream` extension to subscribe to a stream while
    a composition is active:

    ```Kotlin
    @Composable
    fun TodoListPage(db: PowerSyncDatabase, id: String) {
      val syncStream = db.composeSyncStream(name = "list", parameters = mapOf("list_id" to JsonParam.String(id)))
      // Define component based on stream state
    }
    ```

## Example 

Example apps are still in progress. You can follow the below PRs or use them as a reference.

### Dart

You can try the [`supabase-todolist`](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync.dart/tree/streams/demos/supabase-todolist) demo app, which we updated to use Sync Streams (Sync Rules are still supported).

Use the following Sync Stream definitions on the PowerSync Service:
```yaml sync_rules.yaml
config:
  edition: 2
streams:
  lists:
    query: SELECT * FROM lists
    auto_subscribe: true
  todos:
    query: SELECT * FROM todos WHERE list_id = subscription.parameter('list')
```

In this example:
* The app syncs `lists` by default (demonstrating equivalent behavior to Sync Rules, i.e. optimized for offline-first).
* The app syncs `todos` on demand when a user opens a list.
* When the user navigates back to the same list, they won't see a loading state — demonstrating caching behavior.
