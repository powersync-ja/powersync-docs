title: "Case Sensitivity"
description: "For simplicity, we recommend using only lower case identifiers for all table/collection and column/field names used in PowerSync. If you need to use a different case, continue reading."

### Case in Sync Streams

PowerSync converts all table/collection and column/field names to lower-case by default in Sync Stream queries (this is how Postgres also behaves). To preserve the case, surround the names with double quotes, for example:

```sql
SELECT "ID" as id, "Description", "ListID" FROM "TODOs" WHERE "TODOs"."ListID" = subscription.parameter('list_id')
```

When using `SELECT *`, the original case is preserved for the returned columns/fields.

### Client-Side Case

On the client side, the case of table and column names in the [client-side schema](/installation/client-side-setup/define-your-schema) must match the case produced by Sync Streams exactly. For the above example, use the following in Dart:

```dart
  Table('TODOs', [
    Column.text('Description'),
    Column.text('ListID')
  ])
```

SQLite itself is case-insensitive. When querying and modifying the data on the client, any case may be used. For example, the above table may be queried using `SELECT description FROM todos WHERE listid = ?`.

Operations (`PUT`/`PATCH`/`DELETE`) are stored in the upload queue using the case as defined in the schema above for table and column names, not the case used in queries.

As another example, in this Sync Stream query:

```sql
SELECT ID, todo_description as Description FROM todo_items as TODOs
```

Each identifier in the example is unquoted and converted to lower case. That means the client-side schema would be:

```dart
Table('todos', [
  Column.text('description')
])
```
