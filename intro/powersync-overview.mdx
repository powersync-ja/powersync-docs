PowerSync is a sync engine that keeps backend databases in sync with client-side embedded SQLite databases. It lets you avoid the complexities of using APIs to move app state [over the network](https://www.powersync.com/blog/escaping-the-network-tarpit), and enables real-time reactive local-first & offline-first apps that remain available even when network connectivity is poor or non-existent.
