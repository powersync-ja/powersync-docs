[Sync Rules](/usage/sync-rules) allow developers to control which data gets synced to which user devices using a SQL-like syntax in a YAML file. For the demo app, we're going to specify that each user can only see their own to-do lists and list items.

1. The final step is to replace the Sync Rules file's contents with the below:

```yaml
bucket_definitions:
  user_lists:
    # Separate bucket per To-Do list
    parameters: select id as list_id from lists where owner_id = request.user_id()
    data:
      - select * from lists where id = bucket.list_id
      - select * from todos where list_id = bucket.list_id
```

3. Click **"Validate sync rules"** and ensure there are no errors. This validates your sync rules against your Postgres database.
4. Click **"Save and deploy"** to deploy your Sync Rules.

<Tip>
- Your Sync Rules can be updated by navigating to the **Manage instances** workspace and selecting the `sync-rules.yaml` file.
