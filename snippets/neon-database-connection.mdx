1. From your Neon Console, select **Connect** in the top navigation bar. Ensure the format is set to "Connection string", and click on "Copy snippet":

2. In the [PowerSync Dashboard](https://dashboard.powersync.com/), select your project and instance and go to the **Database Connections** view.
3. Click **Connect to Source Database** and ensure the "Postgres" tab is selected.
4. Paste the connection string into the **URI** field. PowerSync will automatically parse this URI to populate the database connection details.
5. Update the **Username** and **Password** fields to use the `powersync_role` and password you created when configuring your Neon for PowerSync (see [Source Database Setup](/installation/database-setup#neon)). 
6. Note: PowerSync includes Neon's CA certificate by default, so you can use `verify-full` SSL mode without additional configuration.

7. Verify your setup by clicking **Test Connection** and resolve any errors.
8. Click **Save Connection**.

PowerSync will now create an isolated cloud environment for your instance. This typically takes a minute or two.

### Configure Neon Auth

After your database connection is configured, enable Neon Auth:

1. In the PowerSync Dashboard, go to the **Client Auth** view.
2. Enable **"Enable development tokens"** (useful for testing).
3. Populate the **"JWKS URI"** with the value from the **"JWKS URL"** field in the Neon Console → Auth → Configuration page.
4. Populate the **"JWT Audience"** with your Neon Auth project root URL (e.g., `https://ep-restless-resonance-adom1z4w.neonauth.c-2.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech`).
<Tip>
The `aud` field is very sensitive, be sure to enter it exactly as shown above, especially removing the trailing `/` character.

5. Click **Save and Deploy** to apply the changes.
