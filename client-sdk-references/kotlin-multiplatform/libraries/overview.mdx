The PowerSync Kotlin SDK allows syncing SQLite databases with your backend database, and gives you full control over which queries you run on your client.

Manually writing SQL queries and parsing results can be prone to errors though.
Libraries like [SQLDelight](https://sqldelight.github.io/sqldelight) and [Room](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room) make this process safer by validating your schema and queries at compile-time, as well as generating code to map from  raw SQLite rows into statically typed structures.

Starting with version `1.6.0` of the PowerSync Kotlin SDK, both SQLDelight and Room are officially supported on all platforms!

<Note>
  We've recently added support for these libraries. We're still seeking feedback on developer experience
  and don't have complete examples for them yet.

  Contributions and feedback are welcome!

If you're not sure which library to use, consider that Room requires [raw tables](/usage/use-case-examples/raw-tables) and is more complex to set up, so:

- SQLDelight is easier to use if you're starting with an existing PowerSync database.
- We mainly recommend the Room integration if you have an existing Room database you want to add sync to.
