PowerSync Cloud **Pro and Team** plans have the limits and performance expectations outlined below.

The PowerSync Cloud **Enterprise** plan allows these limits to be customized based on your specific needs. 

## Limits

| **Component** | **Limit** | **Details** |
|---|---|---|
| **Synced buckets per user** | 1,000 | Sync requests exceeding this will fail with an error. We plan to increase this limit in the future. |
| **Maximum row/document size** | 15MB | Applies to both source database rows and transformed rows synced to clients. |
| **Concurrent connections** | Maximum: configurable (50k+ per instance) | PowerSync Service instances have default limits configured based on the [Pricing plan](https://www.powersync.com/pricing). These limits can be increased upon request and currently scale to over 50,000.  |
| **Storage size** | 100GB | Soft limit for data stored on PowerSync Service (default). |
| **Columns per table** | 1,999 | Hard limit of the client schema, excluding the `id` column. |
| **Number of users** | No limit | No hard limit on unique users. |
| **Number of tables** | No limit | Hundreds of tables may impact startup and sync performance. |

## Performance Expectations

### Database Replication (Source DB → PowerSync Service)

- **Small rows**: 2,000-4,000 operations per second
- **Large rows**: Up to 5MB per second
- **Transaction processing**: ~60 transactions per second for smaller transactions
- **Reprocessing**: Same rates apply when reprocessing sync rules or adding new tables

### Sync (PowerSync Service → Client)

- **Rows per client**: Over 1 million rows supported with no hard limit
  - Database size and initial sync time may impose practical limits on the number of rows
- **Sync speed**: Expect a rate of 2,000-20,000 operations per second per client, depending on the client
