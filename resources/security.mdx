At PowerSync, we take security very seriously and everything we do is designed to be secure throughout the entire software development lifecycle.

### PowerSync Cloud Security

* Customer data is encrypted at rest, access to that data by support staff is strictly controlled by access control mechanisms and robust write-only logging is present across the entire stack.
* All HTTP connections are encrypted using TLS.
* Additionally, customers on our [Enterprise plan](https://www.powersync.com/pricing) can request their data to be housed in managed, isolated tenants.
* SOC 2 Type 2 audit results are available to customers on our [Enterprise plan](https://www.powersync.com/pricing). On our most recent annual SOC 2 audit, we had zero exceptions.
