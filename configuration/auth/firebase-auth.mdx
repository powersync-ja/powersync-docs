description: "Setting up Firebase Authentication with PowerSync"
---

Configure authentication on the PowerSync instance with the following settings:

* JWKS URI: `https://www.googleapis.com/service_accounts/v1/jwk/securetoken@system.gserviceaccount.com`
* JWT Audience: Firebase project ID

Firebase signs these tokens using RS256.

PowerSync will periodically refresh the keys using the above JWKS URI, and validate tokens against the configured audience (token `aud` value).

The Firebase user UID will be available as `request.user_id()` (previously `token_parameters.user_id`.). To use a different identifier as the user ID in sync rules (for example user email), use [Custom authentication](/configuration/auth/custom).

### PowerSync Cloud instances:

1. In the [PowerSync Dashboard](https://dashboard.powersync.com/), select your project and instance and go to the **Client Auth** view.
2. Configure your Firebase JWKS URI and audience settings.
3. Click **Save and Deploy** to apply the changes.

### Self-hosted instances:

This can be configured via your [`config.yaml`](/configuration/powersync-service/self-hosted-service):

```yaml config.yaml
client_auth:
  # JWKS URIs can be specified here.
  jwks_uri: 'https://www.googleapis.com/service_accounts/v1/jwk/securetoken@system.gserviceaccount.com'
  audience: ['<your Firebase project ID>']
```
