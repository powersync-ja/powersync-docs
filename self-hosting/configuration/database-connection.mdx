Below, you can find provider-specific instructions to obtain connection details that you need to specify in your configuration file (see [Service Configuration](/self-hosting/configuration/service-configuration)).

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Supabase">
    1. In your Supabase Dashboard, click **Connect** in the top bar:
        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/installation/supabase-connect-database.png" />
        </Frame>

         -  Under **Direct connection**, copy the connection string. The hostname should be `db.<PROJECT-ID>.supabase.co`, and not, for example, `aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com`.
    
        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/installation/supabase-connection-string.png" />
        </Frame>

         -  Paste this URI into the `uri` field under `replication` \> `connections` in your configuration file, for example:
        ```yaml
          # config.yaml

          replication:
            connections:
              - type: postgresql
                uri: postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@db.abc.supabase.co:5432/postgres
        ```      
    2. Replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` with the password for the `postgres` user in your Supabase database.
       - Supabase also [refers to this password](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/managing-passwords) as the *database password* or *project password*.
    3. PowerSync has the Supabase CA certificate pre-configured — `verify-full` SSL mode can be used directly, without any custom certificates.
    4. Under `client_auth` enable Supabase Authentication:

    ```yaml
    client_auth:
      supabase: true
      supabase_jwt_secret: [secret]
    ```
    For more details, see [Supabase Auth](/configuration/auth/supabase-auth).
