Used in conjunction with **FlutterFlow**, PowerSync enables developers to build local-first apps that are robust in poor network conditions and that have highly responsive frontends while relying on Supabase for their backend. This guide walks you through configuring PowerSync within your FlutterFlow project that has Supabase integration enabled.

<Tip>
**New and Improved integration**: Welcome to our updated FlutterFlow integration guide. This version introduces a dedicated PowerSync FlutterFlow Library, offering a simpler and more robust solution compared to the [previous version](/integration-guides/flutterflow-+-powersync/powersync-+-flutterflow-legacy) which required extensive custom code.

Key improvements are:
* Uses the new PowerSync FlutterFlow Library
* Supports Web-based test mode
* Streamlined Setup
* No more dozens of custom actions
* Working Attachments package (Coming soon)
</Tip>

## Guide Overview

<Note>
    Before starting this guide, you'll need:
    - A PowerSync account ([sign up here](https://accounts.journeyapps.com/portal/powersync-signup?s=docs)).
    - A Supabase account ([sign up here](https://supabase.com/dashboard/sign-up)).
    - A [paid plan](https://www.flutterflow.io/pricing) with FlutterFlow for the ability to import a Library into a project.
</Note>

This guide walks you through building a basic item management app from scratch and takes about 30-40 minutes to complete. You should then be able to use this knowledge to build and extend your own app.

1. Configure Supabase and PowerSync Prerequisites 
2. Initialize Your FlutterFlow Project
3. Build a Sign-in Screen
4. Read Data
5. Create Data 
6. Update Data (Coming soon)
7. Delete Data
8. Sign Out
9. (New) Display Connectivity and Sync Status
10. Secure Your App
    1. Enable RLS in Supabase
    2. Update Sync Rules in PowerSync

## Configure Supabase

1. Create a new project in Supabase.
2. PowerSync uses the Postgres [Write Ahead Log (WAL)](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-intro.html) to replicate data changes in order to keep PowerSync SDK clients up to date.
3. Run the below SQL statement in your **Supabase SQL Editor**:
   ```sql
   create table
   public.lists (
      id uuid not null default gen_random_uuid (),
      created_at timestamp with time zone not null default now(),
      name text not null,
      owner_id uuid not null,
      constraint lists_pkey primary key (id),
      constraint lists_owner_id_fkey foreign key (owner_id) references auth.users (id) on delete cascade
   ) tablespace pg_default
   ```
4. Create a Postgres publication using the SQL Editor. This will enable data to be replicated from Supabase so that your FlutterFlow app can download it.
   ```sql
   create publication powersync for table public.lists;
   ```
   <Note>
      This is a static list of tables. If you add additional tables to your schema, they must also be added to this publication.
   </Note>

   <Info>
      This guide uses the default `postgres` user in your Supabase account for replicating changes to PowerSync, since elevating custom roles to replication [has been disabled](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/9314) in Supabase. If you want to use a custom role for this purpose, contact the Supabase support team.
   </Info>

## Configure PowerSync

### Create a PowerSync Cloud Instance
<CreateCloudInstance />

### Connect PowerSync to Your Supabase
<SupabaseConnection />

### Configure Sync Rules

[Sync Rules](/usage/sync-rules) allow developers to control which data gets synced to which user devices using a SQL-like syntax in a YAML file. For the demo app, we're going to specify that each user can only see their own lists.

1. To update your Sync Rules, open the `sync-rules.yaml` file.
   <Frame>
   <img src="/images/integration-22.avif" width="80%"/>
   </Frame>
2. Replace the `sync-rules.yaml` file's contents with the below:
   ```yaml 
   # This will sync the entire table to all users - we will refine this later
   bucket_definitions:
      global:
         data:
               - SELECT * FROM lists
   ```

For additional information on PowerSync's Sync Rules, refer to the [Sync Rules](/usage/sync-rules) documentation.

If you're wondering how Sync Rules relate to Supabase Postgres [RLS](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/row-level-security), see [this subsection](/integration-guides/supabase-+-powersync/rls-and-sync-rules).

## Initialize Your FlutterFlow Project

1. Create a new Blank app, give it a name, and disable Firebase.
2. Under **"App Settings" -> "Integrations"**, enable "Supabase". 
   1. Enter your Supabase "API URL" and public "Anon Key". You can find these under **"Project Settings" -> "API"** in your Supabase dashboard.
   2. Click "Get Schema".
3. Under **"App Settings" -> "Project Dependencies" -> "FlutterFlow Libraries"** click "Add Library". 
   1. Select the "PowerSync" library.
   2. Add your schema:
      1. On the PowerSync Dashboard, right-click on your instance and select "Generate Client-Side Schema" and select "FlutterFlow" as the language.
      <Frame>
         <img src="/images/integration-31.avif"/>
      </Frame>
      2. Copy and paste the generated schema into the "PowerSyncSchema" field.
   3. Copy and paste your PowerSync instance URL into the "PowerSyncURL" field. 
   <Frame>
      <img src="/images/integration-guides/flutterflow/powersync-library-config.png"/>
   </Frame>
   4. Close the library config.

## Build A Sign-In Screen

1. Under the **"Page Selector"**, click **"Add Page, Component, or Flow"**.
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/integration-25.avif"/>
</Frame>
2. Select the "Auth1" template and name the page `Login`.
3. Delete the _Sign Up_, _Forgot Password_ and _Social Login_ buttons â€” we will only be supporting Sign In for this demo app.
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/integration-26.avif"/>
</Frame>
4. Under **"App Settings" -> "App Settings" -> "Authentication"**:
   1. Enable Authentication.
   2. Set "Supabase" as the "Authentication Type".
   3. Set the `Login` page you just created as the "Entry Page".
   4. Set "HomePage" as the "Logged In Page":
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/integration-27.avif"/>
</Frame>
5. In your Supabase Dashboard, under **"Authentication"**, click on **"Add User" -> "Create new user"** and create a user for yourself to test with:
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/integration-28.png" width="60%"/>
</Frame>
6. Test your app with test mode:
<Frame caption="Click on 'Test'">
  <img src="/images/integration-guides/flutterflow/test-run.png"/>
</Frame>

<Check>
   **Checkpoint:** You should now be able to log into the app using the Supabase user account you just created. After logging in you should see a blank screen.

   <Frame caption=" For once, a blank screen means success!">
      <img src="/images/integration-30.avif" width="30%"/>
   </Frame>   
</Check>

## Read Data

We will now create our first UI and bind it to the data in the local SQLite database on the device.

There are three ways to read data from the SQLite database using PowerSync's FlutterFlow library:
1. Auto-updating queries for Layout Elements with Dynamic Children e.g. the ListView Element
   * This uses the library's `PowerSyncQuery` component
2. Auto-updating queries for basic Layout Elements e.g. Text Elements
   * This uses the library's `PowerSyncStateUpdater` component
3. Once-off reads for static data
   * This uses the library's `PowerSyncQueryOnce` custom function

### Prepare Supabase Tables for Reads

For reading data in FlutterFlow, you need a Custom Function per Supabase table to map Supabase rows to data that can be used by the library. This is because FlutterFlow Libraries do not support Supabase classes.

1. Navigate to **"Custom Code"** and add a Custom Function.
2. Name the function `supabaseRowsToList` (if your Supabase table name is "Customers", you would name this `supabaseRowsToCustomers`).
3. Under Function Settings, set the "Return Value" to `Supabase Row`
    1. Check "Is List".
    2. Uncheck "Nullable".
    3. Specify `lists` as the "Table Name".
4. Also under Function Settings, click "Add Arguments".
    1. Set its "Name" to `supabaseRows`
    2. Set its "Type" to "JSON".
    3. Check "Is List".
    4. Uncheck "Nullable".
5. In the Function Code, paste the following code:
    ```dart
    /// MODIFY CODE ONLY BELOW THIS LINE
    return supabaseRows.map((r) => ListsRow(r)).toList();
    ```
6. Click "Save Function".

   </Frame>
    6. Click "Confirm".
    7. Click "Confirm".
5. Still under "Component Parameters" add the SQL query to fetch all list items from the SQLite database:
    1. Paste the following into the "sql [String]" field:
    ```select * from lists order by created_at;```
    2. For this query there are no parameters - this will be covered further down in the guide.
6. Still under "Component Parameters", check "watch [Boolean]". This ensures that the query auto-updates.

#### Test your App

1. Check that there are no project issues or errors.
2. Reload your app or start another test session.
3. Notice that your homepage is still blank. This is because the `lists` table is empty in Supabase. Create a test row in the table by clicking on "Insert" -> "Insert Row" in your Supabase Table Editor.
   1. Leave `id` and `created_at` blank.
   2. Enter a name such as "Test from Supabase".
   3. Click "Select Record" for `owner_id` and select your test user.

<Check>
   **Checkpoint:** You should now see your single test row magically appear in your app:

</Frame>
10. Click "Close".

<Check>
   **Checkpoint:** You should now be able to reload your app and sign out and in again.
</Check>

## (Optional) Display Connectivity and Sync Status

The PowerSync library provides a built-in component that displays real-time connectivity and synchronization status. Since the sync state is available globally as part of your app state, you can easily monitor the database status throughout your application. To add this status indicator:

1. Under the **Widget Palette**, select the "Components and custom widgets imported from library projects" panel.
   <Frame>
      <img src="/images/integration-guides/flutterflow/powersync-components.png"/>
   </Frame>
2. Drag the `PowerSyncConnectivity` component into your home page's "AppBar".
   <Frame>
      <img src="/images/integration-guides/flutterflow/powersync-connectivity.png"/>
   </Frame>

## Secure Your App

PowerSync's [Sync Rules](/usage/sync-rules) and Supabase's support for [Row Level Security (RLS)](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/row-level-security) can be used in conjunction. Here are some high level similarities and differences:

* RLS should be used as the authoritative set of security rules applied to your users' CRUD operations that reach Postgres.
* Sync Rules are only applied for data that is to be downloaded to clients â€” they do not apply to uploaded data.
   * Sync Rules can typically be considered to be complementary to RLS, and will generally mirror your RLS setup.

### Enable RLS in Supabase

Run the below in your Supabase console to ensure that only list owners can perform actions on the lists table where `owner_id` matches their user id:

```sql
alter table public.lists
  enable row level security;

create policy "owned lists" on public.lists for ALL using (
  auth.uid() = owner_id
)
```

### Update Sync Rules

Currently all lists are synced to all users, regardless of who the owner of the list is. You will now update this so that only a user's lists are synced to their device:

1. Navigate to the [PowerSync Dashboard](https://powersync.journeyapps.com/) and open your `sync-rules.yaml` file.

## Known Issues, Limitations and Gotchas

Below is a list of known issues and limitations.

1. Deploying to the Apple App Store currently requires some workarounds due to limitations in FlutterFlow:
   1. Download the code from FlutterFlow.
   2. Open the `Podfile` located in the `ios/` directory.
   3. The following option in the `Podfile` needs to be updated from `use_frameworks! :linkage => :static` to `use_frameworks!` (remove everything after the exclamation sign).
   4. After removing that option, clean the build folder and build the project again.
   5. You should now be able to submit to the App Store.
2. Exporting the code from FlutterFlow using the "Download Code" action in FlutterFlow requires the same workaround listed above.
3. Other common issues and troubleshooting techniques are documented here: [Troubleshooting](/resources/troubleshooting).
