The [current Pro and Team plans](https://www.powersync.com/pricing) of PowerSync Cloud have the following limits and expected performance.

The PowerSync Cloud Enterprise plan allows for limits to be customized.

* Number of synced buckets per user: 1,000.
   * Sync requests where this number is exceeded will fail with a hard error.
   * We have plans to increase this limit.
* Maximum row size: 15MB
   * This applies to both the source Postgres row, and the transformed row synced to the client.
* Number of concurrent connections per [PowerSync Service](/architecture/powersync-service) instance: Limited to 3,000 by default.
* Replicated rows (Postgres -> PowerSync Service):
   * Expect a peak of around 2,000-4,000 operations/second for small rows, or 5MB/second for large rows.
   * This also applies to reprocessing sync rules or adding new tables.
   * Smaller transactions are processed at around 60 transactions/second.
* Synced rows (PowerSync Service -> Client):
   * Over 1M rows per client is supported, with no hard limit.
   * Expect a rate of around 2,000-20,000 operations/second/client, depending on the client.
   * Database size and initial sync time may impose practical limits on number of rows.
* Storage size: A soft limit of 100GB for data stored on the PowerSync Service by default.
* Number of unique users: No hard limit.
* Number of tables: No hard limit, but having hundreds of tables may slow down startup and sync performance.
* Number of columns per table: Hard limit of 63 columns per table in the client schema, excluding the id column.
