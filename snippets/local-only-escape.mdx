<Tip>
  **Note**: This section assumes you want to use PowerSync to sync your backend source database with SQLite in your app. If you only want to use PowerSync to manage your local SQLite database without sync, instantiate the PowerSync database without calling `connect()` and refer to our [Local-Only](/client-sdks/advanced/local-only-usage) guide.
