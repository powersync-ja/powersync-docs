PowerSync clients (i.e. apps used by your users that embed the PowerSync Client SDK) authenticate against the server-side [PowerSync Service](/architecture/powersync-service) using [JWTs](https://jwt.io/) (signed tokens) that are generated by your application backend.

Before using PowerSync, an application's existing architecture may look like this:

The [PowerSync Service](/architecture/powersync-service) uses database native credentials and authenticates directly against the [backend database](/installation/database-setup) using the configured credentials:

When the PowerSync client SDK is included in an app project, it uses [existing app-to-backend](/installation/app-backend-setup) authentication to [retrieve a JSON Web Token (JWT)](/installation/authentication-setup):

The PowerSync client SDK uses the retrieved JWT to authenticate directly against the PowerSync Service:

</Frame>

Users are not persisted in PowerSync, and there is no server-to-server communication used for client authentication.

Some authentication providers already generate JWTs for users which PowerSync can verify directly — see the documentation for individual providers (e.g. [Supabase Auth](/installation/authentication-setup/supabase-auth), [Firebase Auth](/installation/authentication-setup/firebase-auth))

For others, some backend code must be added to your application backend to generate the JWTs needed for PowerSync — see [Custom](/installation/authentication-setup/custom) authentication.

For a quick way to get up and running during development, you can generate [Development Tokens](/installation/authentication-setup/development-tokens) directly from the [PowerSync Dashboard](/usage/tools/powersync-dashboard) (PowerSync Cloud) or locally with a self-hosted setup.
