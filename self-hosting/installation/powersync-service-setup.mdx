description: "Configuration details for connecting the PowerSync Service to your database"
---

After configuring your source database for PowerSync, you'll need to setup your [PowerSync Service](/architecture/powersync-service).

This entails:

1. Configuring sync bucket storage

2. Defining your PowerSync config

   1. Defining connections to your source database, and sync bucket storage database

   2. Defining your [Sync Rules](/usage/sync-rules)

   3. Defining your auth method

Examples of the above can be found in our demo application [here](https://github.com/powersync-ja/self-host-demo/tree/main/config). Below we go through these in more detail.

<Tip>
  **Deploy PowerSync on Coolify:** See our [integration guide](/integration-guides/coolify) for deploying the PowerSync Service on Coolify. This can simplify the setup and management of the deployment.
</Tip>

## Configure Sync Bucket Storage

The PowerSync Service requires a storage backend for sync buckets. You can use either MongoDB or Postgres for this purpose. The storage backend is separate from your source database.

### MongoDB Storage

MongoDB requires at least one replica set node. A single node is fine for development/staging environments, but a 3-node replica set is recommended [for production](/self-hosting/lifecycle-maintenance).

[MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-database) enables replica sets by default for new clusters.

However, if you're using your own environment you can enable this manually by running:

```bash
mongosh "mongodb+srv://powersync.abcdef.mongodb.net/" --apiVersion 1 --username myuser --eval 'try{rs.status().ok && quit(0)} catch {} rs.initiate({_id: "rs0", version: 1, members: [{ _id: 0, host : "mongo:27017" }]})'
```

If you are rolling your own Docker environment, you can include this init script in your docker-compose file to configure a replica set as once-off operation:

```yaml
  # Initializes the MongoDB replica set. This service will not usually be actively running
  mongo-rs-init:
    image: mongo:7.0
    depends_on:
      - mongo
    restart: "no"
    entrypoint:
      - bash
      - -c
      - 'sleep 10 && mongosh --host mongo:27017 --eval ''try{rs.status().ok && quit(0)} catch {} rs.initiate({_id: "rs0", version: 1, members: [{ _id: 0, host : "mongo:27017" }]})'''
```

### Postgres Storage (Beta)

Available since version 1.3.8 of [`journeyapps/powersync-service`](https://hub.docker.com/r/journeyapps/powersync-service), you can use Postgres as an alternative storage backend for sync buckets. This feature is currently in [beta](/resources/feature-status).

#### Database Setup

You'll need to create a dedicated user and schema for PowerSync storage. You can either:

1. Let PowerSync create the schema (recommended):

```sql
CREATE USER powersync_storage_user WITH PASSWORD 'secure_password';
-- The user should only have access to the schema it created
GRANT CREATE ON DATABASE postgres TO powersync_storage_user;
```

2. Or manually create the schema:

```sql
CREATE USER powersync_storage_user WITH PASSWORD 'secure_password';
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS powersync AUTHORIZATION powersync_storage_user;
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE postgres TO powersync_storage_user;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA powersync TO powersync_storage_user;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA powersync TO powersync_storage_user;
```

<Tip>
**Demo app:** A demo app with Postgres bucket storage is available [here](https://github.com/powersync-ja/self-host-demo/tree/main/demos/nodejs-postgres-bucket-storage).
</Tip>

## PowerSync Configuration

The PowerSync Service is configured using key/value pairs in a config file, and supports the following configuration methods:

1. Inject config as an environment variable (which contains the base64 encoding of a config file)

2. Use a config file mounted on a volume

3. Specify the config as a command line parameter (again base64 encoded)

Both YAML and JSON config files are supported, and you can see examples of the above configuration methods in our demo app's [docker-compose](https://github.com/powersync-ja/self-host-demo/blob/d61cea4f1e0cc860599e897909f11fb54420c3e6/docker-compose.yaml#L46) file.

A detailed `config.yaml` example with additional comments can be found here:

<Card title="self-host-demo/config/powersync.yaml at main · powersync-ja/self-host-demoGitHub" icon="github" href="https://github.com/powersync-ja/self-host-demo/blob/main/config/powersync.yaml" horizontal />

The config file schema is also available here:

<Card title="self-host-demo/schema/schema.json at main · powersync-ja/self-host-demoGitHub" icon="github" href="https://github.com/powersync-ja/self-host-demo/blob/main/schema/schema.json" horizontal />

Below is a skeleton config file you can copy and paste to edit locally:

```yaml
# config.yaml

# Settings for source database replication
replication:
  # Specify database connection details
  # Note only 1 connection is currently supported
  # Multiple connection support is on the roadmap
  connections:
    - type: postgresql
      # The PowerSync server container can access the Postgres DB via the DB's service name.
      # In this case the hostname is pg-db

      # The connection URI or individual parameters can be specified.
      uri: postgresql://postgres:mypassword@pg-db:5432/postgres

      # SSL settings
      sslmode: disable # 'verify-full' (default) or 'verify-ca' or 'disable'
      # Note: 'disable' is only suitable for local/private networks, not for public networks

# Connection settings for sync bucket storage (MongoDB and Postgres are supported)
storage:
  # Option 1: MongoDB Storage
  type: mongodb
  uri: mongodb://mongo:27017/powersync_demo
  # Use these if authentication is required. The user should have `readWrite` and `dbAdmin` roles
  # username: myuser
  # password: mypassword

  # Option 2: Postgres Storage
  # type: postgresql
  # This accepts the same parameters as a Postgres replication source connection
  # uri: postgresql://powersync_storage_user:secure_password@storage-db:5432/postgres
  # sslmode: disable

# The port which the PowerSync API server will listen on
port: 80

# Specify sync rules
sync_rules:
  content: |
    bucket_definitions:
      global:
        data:
          - SELECT * FROM lists
          - SELECT * FROM todos

# Settings for client authentication
client_auth:
  # Enable this if using Supabase Auth
  # supabase: true
  # supabase_jwt_secret: your-secret

  # JWKS URIs can be specified here.
  jwks_uri: http://demo-backend:6060/api/auth/keys

  # JWKS audience
  audience: ['powersync-dev', 'powersync']

  # Settings for telemetry reporting
  # See https://docs.powersync.com/self-hosting/telemetry
  telemetry:
    # Opt out of reporting anonymized usage metrics to PowerSync telemetry service
    disable_telemetry_sharing: false

```

<Info>
**Important:** When using Postgres for sync bucket storage, a separate server is currently required for replication connections (if using Postgres for replication) and storage. Using the same server might cause unexpected results.
</Info>

Specify the connection to Postgres in the `replication` section. Retrieving your database connection string / individual parameters differs by database hosting provider. See [Database Connection](/self-hosting/appendix/database-connection) for further details.

<Info>
  If you are using hosted Supabase, you will need to enable IPv6 for Docker as per [https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/ipv6/](https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/ipv6/)

  If your host OS does not support Docker IPv6 e.g. macOS, you will need to run Supabase locally.

  This is because Supabase only allows direct database connections over IPv6 — PowerSync cannot connect using the connection pooler.
</Info>

Specify the connection to your sync bucket storage provider (Postgres or MongoDB) in the `storage` section.

### Environment Variables

The config file uses custom tags for environment variable substitution.

Using `!env [variable name]` will substitute the value of the environment variable named `[variable name]`.

Only environment variables with names starting with `PS_` can be substituted.

See examples here:

<Card title="self-host-demo/config/powersync.yaml at main · powersync-ja/self-host-demoGitHub" icon="github" href="https://github.com/powersync-ja/self-host-demo/blob/main/config/powersync.yaml" horizontal />

### Sync Rules

Your project's [sync rules](/self-hosting/installation/powersync-service-setup#sync-rules) can either be specified within your configuration file directly, or in a separate file that is referenced.

```yaml
# config.yaml

# Define sync rules:
sync_rules:
  content: |
    bucket_definitions:
      global:
        data:
          - SELECT * FROM lists
          - SELECT * FROM todos

# Alternatively, reference a sync rules file
# sync_rules:
  # path: sync_rules.yaml
```

We recommend starting with syncing a single table in a [global bucket](/usage/sync-rules/example-global-data). Choose a table and sync it by adding the following to your sync rules:

```yaml
sync_rules:
  content: |
    bucket_definitions:
      global:
        data:
          # Sync all mytable
          - SELECT * FROM mytable
```

For more information about sync rules see:

[Sync Rules](/usage/sync-rules)

<Info>
  **Checkpoint**

  To verify that your sync rules are functioning correctly, inspect the contents of your sync bucket in MongoDB.

  If you are running MongoDB in Docker, run the following:

  ```bash
  docker exec -it {MongoDB container name} mongosh "mongodb://{MongoDB service host}/{MongoDB database name}" --eval "db.bucket_data.find().pretty()"
  # Example
  docker exec -it self-host-demo-mongo-1 mongosh "mongodb://localhost:27017/powersync_demo" --eval "db.bucket_data.find().pretty()"
  ```
