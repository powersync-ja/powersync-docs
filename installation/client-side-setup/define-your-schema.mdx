title: "Define your Schema"
description: "You need to set up your client-side schema in your app project. This involves defining your schema in code using the PowerSync syntax."
---

This schema represents a "view" of the downloaded data. No migrations are required â€” the schema is applied directly when the local PowerSync SQLite database is constructed.

<Info>
**Generate schema automatically (PowerSync Cloud)**

In the [PowerSync Dashboard](/usage/tools/powersync-dashboard), the schema can be generated based off your [Sync Rules](/usage/sync-rules) by right-clicking on an instance and selecting **Generate client-side schema**. Currently, the schema can be generated in JavaScript or Dart. Support for Kotlin is coming soon.

Similar functionality exists in the PowerSync [CLI](/usage/tools/cli).

**Note:** The generated schema will exclude the `id` column, as the client SDK automatically creates an `id` column of type `text`. Consequently, it is not necessary to specify an `id` column in your schema. For additional information on IDs, refer to [Client ID](/usage/sync-rules/client-id).

## Example implementation

For an example implementation of the client-side schema, see the _Getting Started_ section of the SDK reference for your platform:

### <Icon icon="flutter" iconType="solid" size="24"/> Flutter

### <Icon icon="react" iconType="solid" size="24"/> React Native & Expo

* [1\. Define the Schema](/client-sdk-references/react-native-and-expo#id-1.-define-the-schema)

### <Icon icon="js" iconType="solid" size="24"/> JavaScript Web

* [1\. Define the Schema](/client-sdk-references/javascript-web#id-1.-define-the-schema)

### <Icon icon="flag" iconType="solid" size="24"/> Kotlin Multiplatform

* [1\. Define the Schema](/client-sdk-references/kotlin-multiplatform#id-1.-define-the-schema)

### <Icon icon="swift" iconType="solid" size="24"/> Swift
