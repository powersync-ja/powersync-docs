# PSYNC_Rxxxx: Sync Rules issues

- **PSYNC_R0001**:
  Catch-all [Sync Rules](/sync/rules/overview) parsing error, if no more specific error is available

## PSYNC_R11xx: YAML syntax issues

## PSYNC_R12xx: YAML structure (schema) issues

## PSYNC_R21xx: SQL syntax issues

## PSYNC_R22xx: SQL supported feature issues

## PSYNC_R23xx: SQL schema mismatch issues

## PSYNC_R24xx: SQL security warnings

# PSYNC_Sxxxx: Service issues

- **PSYNC_S0001**:
  Internal assertion.
  
  If you see this error, it might indicate a bug in the service code.

- **PSYNC_S0102**:
  TEARDOWN was not acknowledged.
  
  This happens when the TEARDOWN argument was not supplied when running
  the service teardown command. The TEARDOWN argument is required since
  this is a destructive command.
  
  Run the command with `teardown TEARDOWN` to confirm.

## PSYNC_S1xxx: Replication issues

- **PSYNC_S1002**:
  Row too large.
  
  There is a 15MB size limit on every replicated row - rows larger than
  this cannot be replicated.

- **PSYNC_S1003**:
  Sync rules have been locked by another process for replication.
  
  This error is normal in some circumstances:
  1. In some cases, if a process was forcefully terminated, this error may occur for up to a minute.
  2. During rolling deploys, this error may occur until the old process stops replication.
  
  If the error persists for longer, this may indicate that multiple replication processes are running.
  Make sure there is only one replication process apart from rolling deploys.

- **PSYNC_S1004**:
  JSON nested object depth exceeds the limit of 20.
  
  This may occur if there is very deep nesting in JSON or embedded documents.

## PSYNC_S11xx: Postgres replication issues

- **PSYNC_S1101**:
  Replication assertion error.
  
  If you see this error, it might indicate a bug in the service code.

- **PSYNC_S1103**:
  Aborted initial replication.
  
  This is not an actual error - it is expected when the replication process
  is stopped, or if replication is stopped for any other reason.

- **PSYNC_S1104**:
  Explicit cacert is required for `sslmode: verify-ca`.
  
  Use either verify-full, or specify a certificate with verify-ca.

- **PSYNC_S1105**:
  `database` is required in connection config.
  
  Specify the database explicitly, or in the `uri` field.

- **PSYNC_S1106**:
  `hostname` is required in connection config.
  
  Specify the hostname explicitly, or in the `uri` field.

- **PSYNC_S1107**:
  `username` is required in connection config.
  
  Specify the username explicitly, or in the `uri` field.

- **PSYNC_S1108**:
  `password` is required in connection config.
  
  Specify the password explicitly, or in the `uri` field.

- **PSYNC_S1109**:
  Invalid database URI.
  
  Check the URI scheme and format.

- **PSYNC_S1110**:
  Invalid port number.
  
  Only ports in the range 1024 - 65535 are supported.

- **PSYNC_S1141**:
  Publication does not exist.
  
  Run: `CREATE PUBLICATION powersync FOR ALL TABLES` on the source database.

- **PSYNC_S1142**:
  Publication does not publish all changes.
  
  Create a publication using `WITH (publish = "insert, update, delete, truncate")` (the default).

- **PSYNC_S1143**:
  Publication uses publish_via_partition_root.

- **PSYNC_S1144**:
  Invalid Postgres server configuration for replication and sync bucket storage.

  The same Postgres server, running an unsupported version of Postgres, has been configured for both replication and sync bucket storage.
  Using the same Postgres server is only supported on Postgres 14 and above.
  This error typically indicates that the Postgres version is below 14.
  Either upgrade the Postgres server to version 14 or above, or use a different Postgres server for sync bucket storage.

- **PSYNC_S1145**:
  Table has RLS enabled, but the replication role does not have the BYPASSRLS attribute.

  We recommend using a dedicated replication role with the BYPASSRLS attribute for replication:

  ```sql
  ALTER ROLE powersync_role BYPASSRLS
  ```

  An alternative is to create explicit policies for the replication role. If you have done that,
  you may ignore this warning.

## PSYNC_S12xx: MySQL replication issues

## PSYNC_S13xx: MongoDB replication issues

- **PSYNC_S1301**:
  Generic MongoServerError.

- **PSYNC_S1302**:
  Generic MongoNetworkError.

- **PSYNC_S1303**:
  MongoDB internal TLS error.
  
  If connection to a shared cluster on MongoDB Atlas, this could be an IP Access List issue.
  Check that the service IP is allowed to connect to the cluster.

- **PSYNC_S1304**:
  MongoDB connection DNS error.
  
  Check that the hostname is correct.

- **PSYNC_S1305**:
  MongoDB connection timeout.
  
  Check that the hostname is correct, and that the service IP is allowed to connect to the cluster.

- **PSYNC_S1306**:
  MongoDB authentication error.
  
  Check the username and password.

- **PSYNC_S1307**:
  MongoDB authorization error.
  
  Check that the user has the required privileges.

- **PSYNC_S1341**:
  Sharded MongoDB Clusters are not supported yet.

- **PSYNC_S1342**:
  Standalone MongoDB instances are not supported - use a replica-set.

- **PSYNC_S1343**:
  PostImages not enabled on a source collection.
  
  Use `post_images: auto_configure` to configure post images automatically, or enable manually:
  ```
      db.runCommand({
        collMod: 'collection-name',
        changeStreamPreAndPostImages: { enabled: true }
      });
  ```    

- **PSYNC_S1344**:
  The MongoDB Change Stream has been invalidated.
  
  Possible causes:
  - Some change stream documents do not have postImages.
  - startAfter/resumeToken is not valid anymore.
  - The replication connection has changed.
  - The database has been dropped.
  
  Replication will be stopped for this Change Stream. Replication will restart with a new Change Stream.

- **PSYNC_S1345**:
  Failed to read MongoDB Change Stream due to a timeout.
  
  This may happen if there is a significant delay on the source database in reading the change stream.
  
  If this is not resolved after retries, replication may need to be restarted from scratch.

- **PSYNC_S1346**:
  Failed to read MongoDB Change Stream.

  See the error cause for more details.

- **PSYNC_S1347**:
  Timeout while getting a resume token for an initial snapshot.

  This may happen if there is very high load on the source database.

## PSYNC_S14xx: MongoDB storage replication issues

- **PSYNC_S1402**:
  Max transaction tries exceeded.

- **PSYNC_S1500**:
  Required updates in the Change Data Capture (CDC) are no longer available.

  Possible causes:
  - Older data has been cleaned up due to exceeding the retention period.

## PSYNC_S2xxx: Service API

- **PSYNC_S2001**:
  Generic internal server error (HTTP 500).
  
  See the error details for more info.

- **PSYNC_S2002**:
  Route not found (HTTP 404).

- **PSYNC_S2003**:
  503 service unavailable due to restart.
  
  Wait a while then retry the request.

- **PSYNC_S2004**:
  415 unsupported media type.
  
  This code always indicates an issue with the client.

## PSYNC_S21xx: Auth errors originating on the client.

This does not include auth configuration errors on the service.

- **PSYNC_S2101**:
  Generic authentication error.

  Common causes:
  1. **JWT signing key mismatch** (Supabase): The client is using tokens signed with a different key type (legacy vs. new JWT signing keys) than PowerSync expects. If you've migrated to new JWT signing keys, ensure users sign out and back in to get fresh tokens. See [Migrating from Legacy to New JWT Signing Keys](/installation/authentication-setup/supabase-auth#migrating-from-legacy-to-new-jwt-signing-keys).
  2. **Missing or invalid key ID (kid)**: The token's kid header doesn't match any keys in PowerSync's keystore.
  3. **Incorrect JWT secret or JWKS endpoint**: Verify your authentication configuration matches your auth provider's settings.

- **PSYNC_S2102**:
  Could not verify the auth token signature.
  
  Typical causes include:
  1. Token kid is not found in the keystore.
  2. Signature does not match the kid in the keystore.

- **PSYNC_S2103**:
  Token has expired. Check the expiry date on the token.

- **PSYNC_S2104**:
  Token expiration period is too long. Issue shorter-lived tokens.

- **PSYNC_S2105**:
  Token audience does not match expected values.
  
  Check the aud value on the token, compared to the audience values allowed in the service config.

- **PSYNC_S2106**:
  No token provided. An auth token is required for every request.
  
  The Authorization header must start with "Token" or "Bearer", followed by the JWT.

## PSYNC_S22xx: Auth integration errors

- **PSYNC_S2201**:
  Generic auth configuration error. See the message for details.

- **PSYNC_S2202**:
  IPv6 support is not enabled for the JWKS URI.
  
  Use an endpoint that supports IPv4.

- **PSYNC_S2203**:
  IPs in this range are not supported.
  
  Make sure to use a publically-accessible JWKS URI.

- **PSYNC_S2204**:
  JWKS request failed.

## PSYNC_S23xx: Sync API errors

- **PSYNC_S2302**:
  No sync rules available.
  
  This error may happen if:
  1. Sync rules have not been deployed.
  2. Sync rules have been deployed, but is still busy processing.
  
  View the replicator logs to see if the sync rules are being processed.

- **PSYNC_S2304**:
  Maximum active concurrent connections limit has been reached.

- **PSYNC_S2305**:
  Too many buckets.
  
  There is a limit on the number of buckets per active connection (default of 1,000). See [Limit on Number of Buckets Per Client](/sync/rules/organize-data-into-buckets#limit-on-number-of-buckets-per-client) and [Performance and Limits](/resources/performance-and-limits).
