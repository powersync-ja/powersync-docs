title: "RLS and Sync Rules"
---

PowerSync's [Sync Rules](/usage/sync-rules) (or [Sync Streams](/usage/sync-streams.md)) and Supabase's support for [Row Level Security (RLS)](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/row-level-security) can be used in conjunction. Here are some high level similarities and differences:

* RLS should be used as the authoritative set of security rules applied to your users' CRUD operations that reach Postgres.
* Sync Rules/Streams are only applied for data that is to be downloaded to clients â€” they do not apply to uploaded data.
   * Sync Rules/Streams can typically be considered to be complementary to RLS, and will generally mirror your RLS setup.

<Note>
  Supabase tables are often created with auto-increment IDs. For easiest use of PowerSync, make sure to convert them to text IDs as detailed [**here**](/usage/sync-rules/client-id)**.**
</Note>

### Example

Continuing with the schema set up during the guide, below are the RLS policies for the to-do list app:

```sql
alter table public.lists
  enable row level security;

alter table public.todos
  enable row level security;

create policy "owned lists" on public.lists for ALL using (
  auth.uid() = owner_id
);

create policy "todos in owned lists" on public.todos for ALL using (
  auth.uid() IN (
    SELECT lists.owner_id FROM lists WHERE (lists.id = todos.list_id)
  )
);

```

`auth.uid()` in a Supabase RLS policy is the same as:
- `auth.user_id()` in [Sync Streams](/usage/sync-streams.md)
- `request.user_id()` (previously `token_parameters.user_id`) in [Sync Rules](/usage/sync-rules)

If you compare these to your Sync Rules or Sync Streams configuration in `sync-rules.yaml`, you'll see they are quite similar.
