title: "Global Data"
description: 'The simplest Sync Rules are for "global" data â€” synced to all users. '
---

For example, the following Sync Rules sync all `todos` and only unarchived `lists` to all users:

```yaml
bucket_definitions:
  global_bucket:
    data:
      # Sync all todos
      - SELECT * FROM todos
      # Sync all lists except archived ones
      - SELECT * FROM lists WHERE archived = false
```

<Info>
  **Note**: Table names within Sync Rules must match the names defined in the [client-side schema](/installation/client-side-setup/define-your-schema).
