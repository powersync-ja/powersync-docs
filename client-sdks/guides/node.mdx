### SDK Features

<SdkFeatures />

## Quickstart

<NodeInstallation />

Next, make sure that you have:

* Signed up for a PowerSync Cloud account ([here](https://accounts.journeyapps.com/portal/powersync-signup?s=docs)) or [self-host PowerSync](/self-hosting/introduction).
* [Configured your backend database](/installation/database-setup) and connected it to your PowerSync instance.

### 1. Define the Client-Side Schema

The first step is to define the client-side schema, which refers to the schema for the managed SQLite database exposed by the PowerSync Client SDKs, that your app can read from and write to. The client-side schema is typically mainly derived from your backend database schema and [Sync Rules](/usage/sync-rules), but can also include other tables such as local-only tables. Note that schema migrations are not required on the SQLite database due to the schemaless nature of the [PowerSync protocol](/architecture/powersync-protocol): schemaless data is synced to the client-side SQLite database, and the client-side schema is then applied to that data using _SQLite views_ to allow for structured querying of the data. The schema is applied when the local PowerSync database is constructed (as we'll show in the next step).

You can use [this example](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-js/blob/e5a57a539150f4bc174e109d3898b6e533de272f/demos/example-node/src/powersync.ts#L47-L77) as a reference when defining your schema.

<GenerateSchemaAutomatically />

The types available are `text`, `integer` and `real`. These should map directly to the values produced by the [Sync Rules](/usage/sync-rules). If a value doesn't match, it is cast automatically. For details on how backend database types are mapped to the SQLite types, see [Types](/usage/sync-rules/types).

  Select JavaScript and replace the suggested import with `@powersync/node`.

### 2. Instantiate the PowerSync Database

Next, you need to instantiate the PowerSync database. PowerSync streams changes from your backend database into the client-side SQLite database, based on your [Sync Rules](/usage/sync-rules). In your client-side app, you can read from and write to the local SQLite database, whether the user is online or offline. 

**Example**:

```js
import { PowerSyncDatabase } from '@powersync/node';
import { Connector } from './Connector';
import { AppSchema } from './Schema';

export const db = new PowerSyncDatabase({
  // The schema you defined in the previous step
  schema: AppSchema,
  database: {
    // Filename for the SQLite database — it's important to only instantiate one instance per file.
    dbFilename: 'powersync.db',
    // Optional. Directory where the database file is located.'
    // dbLocation: 'path/to/directory'
  },
});
```

### 3. Integrate with your Backend

The PowerSync backend connector provides the connection between your application backend and the PowerSync client-slide managed SQLite database. It is used to:

1. Retrieve an auth token to connect to the PowerSync instance.
2. Upload client-side writes to your backend API. Any writes that are made to the SQLite database are placed into an upload queue by the PowerSync Client SDK and automatically uploaded to your app backend (where you apply those changes to the backend database) when the user is connected. 

Accordingly, the connector must implement two methods:

1. [PowerSyncBackendConnector.fetchCredentials](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-js/blob/ed5bb49b5a1dc579050304fab847feb8d09b45c7/packages/common/src/client/connection/PowerSyncBackendConnector.ts#L16) - This method will be automatically invoked by the PowerSync client SDK every couple of minutes to obtain authentication credentials. See [Authentication Setup](/installation/authentication-setup) for instructions on how the credentials should be generated.
2. [PowerSyncBackendConnector.uploadData](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-js/blob/ed5bb49b5a1dc579050304fab847feb8d09b45c7/packages/common/src/client/connection/PowerSyncBackendConnector.ts#L24) - This method will be automatically invoked by the PowerSync client SDK whenever it needs to upload client-side writes to your app backend via your backend API. Therefore, in your implememtation, you need to define how your backend API is called. See [Writing Client Changes](/installation/app-backend-setup/writing-client-changes) for considerations on the app backend implementation.

**Example**:

```js
import { UpdateType } from '@powersync/node';

export class Connector implements PowerSyncBackendConnector {
    constructor() {
        // Setup a connection to your server for uploads
        this.serverConnectionClient = TODO;
    }

    async fetchCredentials() {
        // Implement fetchCredentials to obtain a JWT from your authentication service.
        // See https://docs.powersync.com/installation/authentication-setup
        // If you're using Supabase or Firebase, you can re-use the JWT from those clients, see
        // - https://docs.powersync.com/installation/authentication-setup/supabase-auth
        // - https://docs.powersync.com/installation/authentication-setup/firebase-auth
        return {
            endpoint: '[Your PowerSync instance URL or self-hosted endpoint]',
            // Use a development token (see Authentication Setup https://docs.powersync.com/installation/authentication-setup/development-tokens) to get up and running quickly
            token: 'An authentication token'
        };
    }

    async uploadData(database) {
      // Implement uploadData to send local changes to your backend service.
      // You can omit this method if you only want to sync data from the database to the client

      // See example implementation here: https://docs.powersync.com/client-sdk-references/javascript-web#3-integrate-with-your-backend
    }
}
```

With your database instantiated and your connector ready, call `connect` to start the synchronization process:

```js
await db.connect(new Connector());
await db.waitForFirstSync(); // Optional, to wait for a complete snapshot of data to be available
```

## Usage

After connecting the client database, it is ready to be used. The API to run queries and updates is identical to our
[JavaScript/Web SDK](/client-sdk-references/javascript-web#using-powersync%3A-crud-functions):

```js
// Use db.get() to fetch a single row:
console.log(await db.get('SELECT powersync_rs_version();'));

// Or db.getAll() to fetch all:
console.log(await db.getAll('SELECT * FROM lists;'));

// And db.execute for inserts, updates and deletes:
await db.execute(
  "INSERT INTO lists (id, created_at, name, owner_id) VALUEs (uuid(), datetime('now'), ?, uuid());",
  ['My new list']
);
```

### Watch Queries

The `db.watch()` method executes a read query whenever a change to a dependent table is made.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="AsyncIterator approach">
  <JavaScriptAsyncWatch />
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Callback approach">
  <JavaScriptCallbackWatch />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

For advanced watch query features like incremental updates and differential results, see [Live Queries / Watch Queries](/usage/use-case-examples/watch-queries).


PowerSync runs queries asynchronously on a background pool of workers and automatically configures WAL to allow a writer and multiple readers to operate in parallel.

## Configure Logging

```js
import { createBaseLogger, LogLevel } from '@powersync/node';

const logger = createBaseLogger();

// Configure the logger to use the default console output
logger.useDefaults();

// Set the minimum log level to DEBUG to see all log messages
// Available levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, TRACE, OFF
logger.setLevel(LogLevel.DEBUG);
```

<Tip>
  Enable verbose output in the developer tools for detailed logs.
</Tip>

## Encryption and custom SQLite drivers

The SDK has an optional dependency on `better-sqlite3` which is used as the default SQLite
driver for that package.
Because that dependency is optional, it can be replaced or removed to customize how SQLite
gets loaded. This section lists common options.

### Encryption

To encrypt databases managed by the PowerSync SDK for Node.js, replace the `better-sqlite3`
dependency with the [`better-sqlite3-multiple-ciphers`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/better-sqlite3-multiple-ciphers) fork.
That package has the same API as `better-sqlite3` while bundling [SQLite3MultipleCiphers](https://github.com/utelle/SQLite3MultipleCiphers)
instead of upstream SQLite.

<Tip>
The [node example](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-js/tree/main/demos/example-node) in the PowerSync
repository can use both `better-sqlite3` and `better-sqlite3-multiple-ciphers` and may be a useful example here.
</Tip>

Because PowerSync attempts to dynamically load `better-sqlite3` at runtime, using a different package
requires patching the database worker. To do that, create a file (say `database.worker.js`) with the following
contents:

```Typescript
// This worker uses bindings to sqlite3 multiple ciphers instead of the original better-sqlite3 worker.
import Database from 'better-sqlite3-multiple-ciphers';

import { startPowerSyncWorker } from '@powersync/node/worker.js';

async function resolveBetterSqlite3() {
  return Database;
}

startPowerSyncWorker({ loadBetterSqlite3: resolveBetterSqlite3 });
```

When opening the database, instruct PowerSync to use the custom worker.
Also use the `initializeConnection` option to install an ecryption key:

```Typescript
const encryptionKey = 'todo: generate encryption key and store it safely';

const db = new PowerSyncDatabase({
  schema: AppSchema,
  database: {
    dbFilename: 'app.db',
    openWorker: (_, options) => {
      return new Worker(new URL('./database.worker.js', import.meta.url), options);
    },
    initializeConnection: async (db) => {
      if (encryptionKey.length) {
        const escapedKey = encryptionKey.replace("'", "''");
        await db.execute(`pragma key = '${escapedKey}'`);
      }

      // Make sure the database is readable, this fails early if the key is wrong.
      await db.execute('pragma user_version');
    }
  },
  logger
});
```

<Note>
If you're using a custom compilation toolchain, for instance because you're compiling from TypeScript
or are applying a bundler to your project, loading workers may require additional configuration on that
toolchain.
</Note>

### `node:sqlite`

Recent versions of Node.js contain an [experimental SQLite API](https://nodejs.org/api/sqlite.html).
Using the builtin SQLite API can reduce code size and external native dependencies. To enable it,
remove your dependency on `better-sqlite3` and configure PowerSync to use the builtin APIs:

```JavaScript
const database = new PowerSyncDatabase({
  schema: AppSchema,
  database: {
    dbFilename: 'app.db',
    dbLocation: directory,
    // Use node:sqlite instead of better-sqlite3
    implementation: { type: 'node:sqlite' }
  }
});
```

<Danger>
There are stability issues when using PowerSync with this API, and it's not recommended outside of
testing purposes at the moment.
</Danger>
