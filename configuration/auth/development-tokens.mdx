title: "Development Tokens"
---

PowerSync allows generating temporary development tokens for authentication. 

This is useful for developers who want to get up and running quickly, without a full custom auth implementation. 
This may also be used to generate a token for a specific user to debug issues.

## Generating a Development Token

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="PowerSync Cloud">
    1. In the [PowerSync Dashboard](https://dashboard.powersync.com/), select your project and instance
    2. Go to the **Client Auth** view
    3. Check the "Enable development tokens" setting and save your changes
    4. Click the **Connect** button in the top bar
    5. Enter a user ID:
       - If you're using **global Sync Rules**, you can enter any value (e.g., `test-user`) since all data syncs to all users
       - If you're using **user-specific Sync Rules**, enter a user ID that matches a user in your database (this will be used as `request.user_id()` in your Sync Rules)
    6. Click **Generate Token** and copy the token

    <Note>
      Development tokens expire after 12 hours.
    </Note>

  <Tab title="Self-Hosted">
    For self-hosted setups, you can generate development tokens using the [powersync-service test-client](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-service/tree/main/test-client):

    #### Step 1: Generate a shared secret

    To generate a shared secret, you can use an online JWS key generator like [this one](https://8gwifi.org/jwsgen.jsp) (not affiliated with PowerSync).

    <Note>
      You don't need to edit the default payload in the [JWS key generator](https://8gwifi.org/jwsgen.jsp).
      You simply need to obtain the generated shared secret value.
    </Note>

    1. Click **Generate JWS Keys & Sign**
    2. Copy the shared secret value

    <Warning>
      Using an online key generator for secrets in a production environment is not recommended. 
    </Warning>

    #### Step 2: Update `powersync.yaml`

    Update the `k` value in the `jwks` `keys` in your `powersync.yaml` config file with the shared secret value copied in the previous step:

    ```yaml powersync.yaml
    # Client (application end user) authentication settings
    client_auth:
        # JWKS URIs can be specified here
        jwks_uri: !env PS_JWKS_URL
        jwks:
            keys:
                - kty: 'oct'
                  k: 'YOUR_GENERATED_SHARED_SECRET'
                  alg: 'HS256'
    ```

    #### Step 3: Generate a development token

    1. If you have not done so already, clone the [powersync-service repo](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-service/tree/main)
    2. Install the dependencies:
       - In the project root, run the following commands:
         ```bash
         pnpm install
         pnpm build:packages
         ```
       - In the `test-client` directory, run the following commands:
         ```bash
         pnpm build
         ```
    3. Generate a new token by running the following command in the `test-client` directory with your updated `powersync.yaml` config file:
       ```bash
       node dist/bin.js generate-token --config path/to/powersync.yaml --sub test-user
       ```
       
       Replace `test-user` with the user ID you want to authenticate:
       - If you're using **global Sync Rules**, you can use any value (e.g., `test-user`) since all data syncs to all users
       - If you're using **user-specific Sync Rules**, use a user ID that matches a user in your database (this will be used as `request.user_id()` in your Sync Rules)

    <Note>
      Development tokens expire after 12 hours.

## Usage

Development tokens can be used either with the [Sync Diagnostics Client](https://diagnostics-app.powersync.com) or the [test-client](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-service/tree/main/test-client).

### Using with Sync Diagnostics Client

The [Sync Diagnostics Client](https://diagnostics-app.powersync.com) allows you to quickly inspect a user's local database and verify that your PowerSync Service configuration and Sync Rules behave as expected.

1. Open the [Sync Diagnostics Client](https://diagnostics-app.powersync.com)
2. Enter your PowerSync Service endpoint
3. Enter the generated development token
4. Inspect the synced data in SQLite

### Using with Your Application

To use the temporary development token in your application, update the `fetchCredentials()` function in your backend connector to return the generated token (see [Integrate with your Backend](/configuration/app-backend/client-side-integration) for more information).

Example:

```js
return PowerSyncCredentials(
        endpoint: AppConfig.powersyncUrl,
        token: 'temp-token-here');
```
