## Overview

It's therefore recommend to first quickly scan the content in [Custom Types, Arrays and JSON](/usage/use-case-examples/custom-types-arrays-and-json)

PowerSync integrates well with PostGIS and provides tools for working with geo data.

### PostGIS

In Supabase, the PostGIS extension needs to be added to your project to use this type. Run the following command in the SQL editor to include the PostGIS extension:

```sql
CREATE extension IF NOT EXISTS postgis;
```

The `geography` and `geometry` types are now available in your Postgres.

## Supabase Configuration Example:

This example builds on the To-Do List demo app in our [Supabase integration guide](/integration-guides/supabase-+-powersync).

### Add custom type, array and PostGIS columns to the `todos` table

```sql
--SQL command to update the todos table with 3 additional columns:

ALTER TABLE todos
ADD COLUMN address location_address null,
ADD COLUMN contact_numbers text [] null,
ADD COLUMN location geography (point) null
```

### Insert a row of data into the table

```sql
-- Grab the id of a list object and a user id and create a new todos
INSERT INTO public.todos(description, list_id, created_by, address, location, contact_numbers) VALUES ('Bread', 'list_id', 'user_id', '("1000 S Colorado Blvd.","Denver","CO",80211)', st_point(39.742043, -104.991531), '{000-000-0000, 000-000-0000, 000-000-0000}');
```

Note the following:

**Custom type**: Specify the value for the `address` column by wrapping the value in single quotes and comma separate the different location\_address properties.

* `'("1000 S Colorado Blvd.","Denver","CO",80211)'`

**Array**: Specify the value of the `contact_numbers` column, by surrounding the comma-separated array items in curly braces.

* `'{000-000-0000, 000-000-0000, 000-000-0000}'`

**PostGIS**: Specify the value of the `location` column by using the `st_point` function and pass in the latitude and longitude

* `st_point(39.742043, -104.991531)`

### What this data looks like when querying from the PowerSync Dashboard

These data types show up as follows when querying from the [PowerSync Dashboard](https://powersync.journeyapps.com/)'s SQL Query editor:

```sql
SELECT * from todos WHERE location IS NOT NULL
```

| location                                           |
| -------------------------------------------------- |
| 0101000020E6100000E59CD843FBDE4340E9818FC18AC052C0 |

This is Postgres' internal binary representation of the PostGIS type.

## On the Client

### AppSchema example

```js
export const AppSchema = new Schema([
  new Table({
    name: 'todos',
    columns: [
      new Column({ name: 'list_id', type: ColumnType.TEXT }),
      new Column({ name: 'created_at', type: ColumnType.TEXT }),
      new Column({ name: 'completed_at', type: ColumnType.TEXT }),
      new Column({ name: 'description', type: ColumnType.TEXT }),
      new Column({ name: 'completed', type: ColumnType.INTEGER }),
      new Column({ name: 'created_by', type: ColumnType.TEXT }),
      new Column({ name: 'completed_by', type: ColumnType.TEXT }),
      new Column({name: 'address', type: ColumnType.TEXT}),
      new Column({name: 'contact_numbers', type: ColumnType.TEXT})
      new Column({name: 'location', type: ColumnType.TEXT}),
    ],
    indexes: [new Index({ name: 'list', columns: [new IndexedColumn({ name: 'list_id' })] })]
  }),
  new Table({
    name: 'lists',
    columns: [
      new Column({ name: 'created_at', type: ColumnType.TEXT }),
      new Column({ name: 'name', type: ColumnType.TEXT }),
      new Column({ name: 'owner_id', type: ColumnType.TEXT })
    ]
  })
]);
```

Note:

* The custom type, array and PostGIS type have been defined as `TEXT` in the AppSchema. The Postgres PostGIS capabilities are not available because the PowerSync SDK uses SQLite, which only has a limited number of types. This means that everything is replicated into the SQLite database as TEXT values.
* Depending on your application, you may need to implement functions in the client to parse the values and then other functions to write them back to the Postgres database.

### What does the data look like in SQLite?

The data looks exactly how it’s stored in the Postgres database i.e.

1. **Custom Type**: It has the same format as if you inserted it using a SQL statement, i.e.
   1. `(1000 S Colorado Blvd.,Denver,CO,80211)`
2. **Array**: Array types act similar in that it shows the data in the same way it was inserted e.g
   1. `{000-000-0000, 000-000-0000, 000-000-0000}`
3. **PostGIS**: The `geography` type is transformed into an encoded form of the value.
   1. If you insert coordinates as `st_point(39.742043, -104.991531)` then it is shown as `0101000020E6100000E59CD843FBDE4340E9818FC18AC052C0`

## Sync Rules

### PostGIS

Example use case: Extract x (long) and y (lat) values from a PostGIS type, to use these values independently in an application.

Currently, PowerSync supports the following functions that can be used when selecting data in your sync rules: [Operators and Functions](/usage/sync-rules/operators-and-functions)

1. `ST_AsGeoJSON`
2. `ST_AsText`
3. `ST_X`
4. `ST_Y`

<Note>
  IMPORTANT NOTE: These functions will only work if your Postgres instance has the PostGIS extension installed and you’re storing values as type `geography` or `geometry`.
</Note>

```yaml
# sync-rules.yaml
bucket_definitions:
  global:
    data:
      - SELECT * FROM lists
      - SELECT *, st_x(location) as longitude, st_y(location) as latitude from todos
```
<Note>
  NOTE: It should be noted that for the above example to work, your AppSchema must have the corresponding `longitude` and `latitude` columns set as `TEXT` type to receive said data.
</Note>
