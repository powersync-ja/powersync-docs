title: "Prioritizied Sync"
description: "In some scenarios, you may want to sync tables using different priorities. For example, you may want to sync a subset of all tables first to log a user in as fast as possible, then sync the reamining tables in the background."
---

## Overview

The general approach is as follows:

1. Define how many priority types you want - typically only two are needed: "high priority" and "the rest"
2. Create a sync bucket for each priority type
3. Use [client parameters](/usage/sync-rules/advanced-topics/client-parameters) to control which priorities you want the client to sync

## Example
Suppose we have two tables: `lists` and `todos` (as per the standard todolist demo app [schema](/integration-guides/supabase-+-powersync#create-the-demo-database-schema)). We want the sync to behave as follows:

1. First, sync all the user's lists, enabling us to render the initial screen in the app
2. Then, sync the user's todos

Below are the sync rules that will enable this:

```yaml
bucket_definitions:
  # sync high priority tables first, in this case the user's lists
  high_priority:
    parameters: select id as list_id from lists where owner_id = token_parameters.user_id and (request.parameters() ->> 'high_priority' = 'true')
    data:
        - select * from lists where id = bucket.list_id
  # sync any remaining tables, in this case todo items
  remaining:
    parameters: select id as list_id from lists where owner_id = token_parameters.user_id and (request.parameters() ->> 'remaining_tables' = 'true')
    data: 
        - select * from todos where list_id = bucket.list_id
```

It is recommended to set Client Parammeters in the [Diagnostics App](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-js/tree/main/tools/diagnostics-app) to verify functionality at this point:

If everything checks out, you can then proceed to implement the client parameter switching accordingly in your app.
