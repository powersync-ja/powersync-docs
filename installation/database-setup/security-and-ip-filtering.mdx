## <Icon icon="elephant" iconType="solid" size="24"/> TLS with Postgres

PowerSync always [enforces TLS](/usage/lifecycle-maintenance/postgres-maintenance#tls) on connections to the database, and certificate validation cannot be disabled.

## PowerSync Cloud: IP Filtering

For additional peace of mind, access to the database may be limited to the following IP addresses if you are using **PowerSync Cloud**:

### US Region

```
50.19.5.255
34.193.39.149
18.234.18.91
18.233.128.219
34.202.251.156
```

### EU Region

```
79.125.70.43
18.200.209.88
18.234.18.91
18.233.128.219
34.202.251.156
```

### JP Region

```
54.248.194.85
57.180.73.135
18.234.18.91
18.233.128.219
34.202.251.156
```

### IPv6 - All regions

```
2602:817::/44
```

Do not rely on IP filtering as a primary form of security. Always use strong database passwords, and use client certificates if additional security is required.
