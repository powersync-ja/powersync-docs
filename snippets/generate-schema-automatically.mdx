  **Generate schema automatically**

  In the [PowerSync Dashboard](https://dashboard.powersync.com/), select your project and instance and click the **Connect** button in the top bar to generate the client-side schema in your preferred language. The schema will be generated based off your Sync Rules.

  Similar functionality exists in the [CLI](/tools/cli).

  **Note:** The generated schema will exclude an `id` column, as the client SDK automatically creates an `id` column of type `text`. Consequently, it is not necessary to specify an `id` column in your schema. For additional information on IDs, refer to [Client ID](/sync/advanced/client-id).
