Add the [PowerSync SDK](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.powersync/core) to your project by adding the following to your `build.gradle.kts` file:

<Tabs sync={false}>
  <Tab title="With Version catalog">
```toml gradle/libs.versions.toml
[versions]
# Please check the latest version at https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-kotlin/releases/
powersync = "1.10.0"

[libraries]
powersync-core = { module = "com.powersync:core", version.ref = "powersync" }
powersync-integration-supabase = { module = "com.powersync:connector-supabase", version.ref = "powersync" }
```

```Kotlin build.gradle.kts icon="/logo/gradle.svg"
kotlin {
    //...
    sourceSets {
        commonMain.dependencies {
            implementation(libs.powersync.core)
            // If you want to use the Supabase Connector, also add the following:
            implementation(libs.powersync.integration.supabase)
        }
        //...
    }
}
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Direct dependency">
```Kotlin build.gradle.kts icon="/logo/gradle.svg"
kotlin {
    //...
    sourceSets {
        commonMain.dependencies {
            implementation("com.powersync:core:$powersyncVersion")
            // If you want to use the Supabase Connector, also add the following:
            implementation("com.powersync:connector-supabase:$powersyncVersion")
        }
        //...
    }
}
```

In a Kotlin-Multiplatform project targeting iOS, macOS, tvOS or watchOS, you also need to
install the PowerSync SQLite extension.
The best way to do that depends on how you [integrate Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform/multiplatform-ios-integration-overview.html) into the XCode project.

<Tabs sync={false}>
  <Tab title="Direct integration">
  PowerSync works with the [direct integration](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform/multiplatform-direct-integration.html), you can add the SQLite extension as a dependency
  in XCode. In your XCode project settings, under "Package Dependencies", add a package and use
  `https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-sqlite-core-swift.git` as a package URL.
  Use a version dependency and start with the [latest version](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-sqlite-core-swift/releases) to get started.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Integration with SPM">
  If you have an existing `Package.swift` file, depend on the SQLite extension like this:

  ```Swift Package.swift
    dependencies: [
        .package(
            url: "https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-sqlite-core-swift.git",
            // Refer to github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-sqlite-core-swift/releases for the latest version.
            exact: "0.4.11",
        )
    ]
  ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="CocoaPods (deprecated)">
  Note that CocoaPods will become read-only in late 2026, and we won't be able to update the
  SQLite extension through CocoaPods afterwards.

  Add the following to the `cocoapods` config in your `build.gradle.kts`:

  ```Kotlin
  cocoapods {
      //...
      pod("powersync-sqlite-core") {
          linkOnly = true
      }

      framework {
          isStatic = true
          export("com.powersync:core")
      }
      //...
  }
  ```

  The `linkOnly = true` attribute and `isStatic = true` framework setting ensure that the `powersync-sqlite-core` binaries are statically linked.
  </Tab>

For Android and JVM targets, the extension is embedded in the SDK and doesn't need to be installed manually.
