The PowerSync Dashboard is available in [PowerSync Cloud](https://www.powersync.com/pricing) (our cloud-hosted offering) and provides an interface for managing your PowerSync organization, projects, instances, and account settings.

The dashboard is available here: https://dashboard.powersync.com/

<Note>
  We have rebuilt the dashboard from the ground up for improved performance and usability.

  We are actively working on migrating a few remaining features and polishing the experience.

  If you run into blocking issues, you can still access the legacy dashboard: [https://powersync.journeyapps.com/](https://powersync.journeyapps.com/). 
  
  Please reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/powersync) if you need help or have feedback.

### Hierarchy: Organization, project, instance

- After successfully [signing up](https://accounts.journeyapps.com/portal/powersync-signup?s=docs) for PowerSync Cloud, your **PowerSync account** is created.
- Your account is assigned an **organization** on the [Free pricing plan](https://www.powersync.com/pricing).
- To get started, you'll need to create a **project** in your organization.

</Frame>

When you click "Create a New Project", you can opt to create a _Development_ and _Production_ **instance** automatically for that project (recommended). An instance runs a copy of the [PowerSync Service](/architecture/powersync-service) and connects to your [backend database](/installation/database-connection). You can also update region for each instance from US to EU, JP (Japan), AU (Australia) or BR (Brazil).

Here is an example of how this hierarchy might be used by a customer:

- **Organization**: Wanderlust Inc.
  - **Project**: Wanderlust Tracker
    - **Instance**: Development
    - **Instance**: Production

### Dashboard Overview

The PowerSync Dashboard is organized into three main levels, each providing different functionality:

1. **Organization Level** - Manage projects, team members, organization and billingsettings
2. **Account Level** - Manage your personal account settings and access tokens
3. **Project & Instance Level** - Configure and monitor your PowerSync instances

### Organization Level

URL structure: `https://dashboard.powersync.com/org/{orgId}/projects`

At the organization level, you can manage your PowerSync projects and organization-wide settings. Navigate to your organization to access:

- **Projects** - View all projects in your organization, create new projects, and manage project settings
- **Team** - Invite team members to your organization, manage user roles, and remove access
- **Plans & Billing** - View or update your PowerSync subscription plan and manage billing details

At the account level, you can manage your personal account settings:

- **Account Details** - View your account email and name
- **Security** - Reset your password and configure multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- **Access Tokens** - Create and manage personal access tokens for use with the [CLI](/usage/tools/cli)

### Project & Instance Level

URL structure: `https://dashboard.powersync.com/org/{orgId}/project/{projectId}/{instanceId}/{view}`

When you navigate to a specific instance, you'll see a left sidebar with various views for configuring and monitoring that instance:

- **Health** - Overview of its connection health, deploy history, replication status, and recently connected clients
- **Database Connections** - Configure and manage the source database connection
- **Client Auth** - Configure authentication settings
- **Sync Rules** - Edit, validate, and deploy your Sync Rules
- **Sync Test** - Test your Sync Rules configuration

- **Write API** - Resources for exposing the write API endpoint
- **Logs** - View replication and service logs
- **Metrics** - Monitor usage metrics and performance
- **Settings** - Advanced options such as [compacting or defragmenting sync buckets](/usage/lifecycle-maintenance/compacting-buckets) using the **Compact** and **Defragment** buttons, and managing instance lifecycle with the **Deprovision instance** and **Destroy instance** buttons in the Danger zone

In the top bar, you'll see a "Connect" button that provides quick access to your instance URL and other resources for connecting to your instance.

#### Advanced: Service Version Locking

Customers on our [Team and Enterprise plans](https://www.powersync.com/pricing) can lock their PowerSync Cloud instances to a specific version of the PowerSync Service. This option is available under your instance settings.

Versions are specified as `major.minor.patch`. When locked, only new `.patch` releases will automatically be applied to the instance.

**Downgrade limitations:** Not all downgrade paths are available automatically. If you need to downgrade to an older version, please [contact our team](/resources/contact-us) for assistance.
