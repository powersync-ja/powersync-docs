The PowerSync [JavaScript Web SDK](../javascript-web) is compatible with popular Single-Page Application (SPA) frameworks like React, Vue, Angular, and Svelte. For [React](#react-hooks) and [Vue](#vue-composables) specifically, wrapper packages are available to support reactivity and live queries, making it easier for developers to leverage PowerSync's features.

PowerSync also integrates with [TanStack Query for React](#tanstack-query) (details below). This integration provides a wide range of developer tools and paves the way for future live query support in other frameworks.

### Which package should I choose for queries?

For React or React Native apps:

* The [`@powersync/react`](#react-hooks) package is best for most basic use cases, especially when you only need reactive queries with loading and error states.

* For more advanced scenarios, such as query caching and pagination, TanStack is a powerful solution. The [`@powersync/tanstack-react-query`](#tanstack-query) package extends the `useQuery` hook from `@powersync/react` and adds functionality from [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview), making it a better fit for advanced use cases or performance-optimized apps.

If you have a Vue app, use the Vue-specific package: [`@powersync/vue`](#vue-composables).

## React Hooks

<Card title="npm: @powersync/react" icon="npm" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@powersync/react" horizontal />

The `@powersync/react` package provides React hooks for use with the [JavaScript Web SDK](./) or [React Native SDK](../react-native-and-expo/). These hooks are designed to support reactivity, and can be used to automatically re-render React components when query results update or to access PowerSync connectivity status changes.

The main hooks available are:

* `useQuery`: This allows you to access the results of a watched query. The response includes `isLoading`, `isFetching` and `error` properties.

* `useStatus`: Access the PowerSync connectivity status. This can be used to update the UI based on whether the client is connected or not.

* `useSuspenseQuery`: This hook also allows you to access the results of a watched query, but its loading and fetching states are handled through [Suspense](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense). It automatically converts certain loading/fetching states into Suspense signals, triggering Suspense boundaries in parent components.

For advanced watch query features like incremental updates and differential results for React Hooks, see [Live Queries / Watch Queries](/usage/use-case-examples/watch-queries).

## TanStack Query

PowerSync integrates with [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview) (formerly React Query) through the `@powersync/tanstack-react-query` package.

<Card title="npm: @powersync/tanstack-react-query" icon="npm" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@powersync/tanstack-react-query" horizontal />

This package wraps TanStack's `useQuery` and `useSuspenseQuery` hooks, bringing many of TanStack's advanced asynchronous state management features to PowerSync web and React Native applications, including:

* **Loading and error states** via [`useQuery`](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/queries)

* [**React Suspense**](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/suspense) **support**: `useSuspenseQuery` automatically converts certain loading states into Suspense signals, triggering Suspense boundaries in parent components.

* [**Caching queries**](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/caching): Queries are cached with a unique key and reused across the app, so subsequent instances of the same query won't refire unnecessarily.

* **Built-in support for** [**pagination**](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/paginated-queries)

  #### Additional hooks

  We plan to support more TanStack Query hooks over time. If there are specific hooks you're interested in, please let us know on [Discord](https://discord.gg/powersync).

### Example Use Case

When navigating to or refreshing a page, you may notice a brief UI "flicker" (10-50ms). Here are a few ways to manage this with TanStack Query:

* **First load**: When a page loads for the first time, use a loading indicator or a Suspense fallback to handle queries. See the [examples](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@powersync/tanstack-react-query#usage).

* **Subsequent loads**: With TanStack's query caching, subsequent loads of the same page won't refire queries, which reduces the flicker effect.

* **Block navigation until components are ready**: Using `useSuspenseQuery`, you can ensure that navigation from page A to page B only happens after the queries for page B have loaded. You can do this by combining `useSuspenseQuery` with the `<Suspense />` element and React Routerâ€™s [`v7_startTransition`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/upgrading/future#v7_starttransition) future flag, which blocks navigation until all suspending components are ready.

### Usage and Examples

## Vue Composables

<Card title="npm: @powersync/vue" icon="npm" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@powersync/vue" horizontal />

The [`powersync/vue`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@powersync/vue) package is a Vue-specific wrapper for PowerSync. It provides Vue [composables](https://vuejs.org/guide/reusability/composables) that are designed to support reactivity, and can be used to automatically re-render components when query results update or to access PowerSync connectivity status changes.

The main hooks available are:

* `useQuery`: This allows you to access the results of a watched query. The response includes `isLoading`, `isFetching` and `error` properties.

* `useStatus`: Access the PowerSync connectivity status. This can be used to update the UI based on whether the client is connected or not.
