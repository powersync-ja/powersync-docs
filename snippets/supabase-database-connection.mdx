1. From your Supabase Dashboard, select **Connect** in the top navigation bar:

  </Frame>

   * In the **Direct connection** section, copy the complete connection string (including the `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` placeholder)

  </Frame>

   * Paste the connection string into the PowerSync instance **URI** field. PowerSync will automatically parse this URI to populate the connection details.

   * For the **Password** field, enter your database's `postgres` user password (this is your database/project password, not your Supabase account password). Need help? Check Supabase's guide on [managing database passwords](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/managing-passwords).

   * Note: PowerSync includes Supabase's CA certificate by default, so you can use `verify-full` SSL mode without additional configuration.

  Your connection settings should look similar to this:

2. Verify your setup by clicking **Test Connection** and resolve any errors.

3. Click **Next**.
4. PowerSync will detect the Supabase connection and prompt you to enable Supabase auth. To enable it, copy your JWT Secret from the Supabase Dashboard's API settings and paste it into the form:

5. Click **Enable Supabase auth** to finalize your connections settings.

<Tip>
You can update your instance settings by navigating to the **Manage instances** workspace, opening your instance options and selecting **Edit instance**.

PowerSync will now create an isolated cloud environment for your instance. This process typically takes a few minutes.
