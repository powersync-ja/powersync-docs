# Service Release Channels

PowerSync Service features are deployed to different release channels throughout their lifecycle.

## Open Edition

The latest stable PowerSync Docker image is available under the latest tag and can be pulled using:

```bash
docker pull journeyapps/powersync-service:latest
```

Development images may be released for bleeding edge feature additions or hotfix testing purposes. These images are usually versioned as a `0.0.0-dev-XXXXXXXXXXXXXX` prereleases.

## PowerSync Cloud 

In the PowerSync Dashboard, developers can configure the service version channel for each instance under the `General` tab in the `Edit Instance` dialog.

### Stable

The Stable channel provides the most reliable release of the PowerSync service. It includes features that may be in the `V1`, `Beta`, or `Open Alpha` stages. `Open Alpha` features in this channel are typically mature but may still have bugs or known issues.

### Next

The Next channel builds on the Stable channel and includes new features, fixes, or modifications to existing stable functionality that may require additional testing or validation.
