**Peer dependencies**

The PowerSync SDK for Node.js supports multiple drivers. More details are available under [encryption and custom drivers](/client-sdks/reference/node#encryption-and-custom-sqlite-drivers),
we currently recommend the `better-sqlite3` package for most users:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install better-sqlite3
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add better-sqlite3
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm install better-sqlite3
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
Previous versions of the PowerSync SDK for Node.js used the `@powersync/better-sqlite3` fork as a
required peer dependency.
This is no longer recommended. After upgrading to `@powersync/node` version `0.12.0` or later, ensure
the old package is no longer installed by running `@powersync/better-sqlite3`.
</Warning>

**Common installation issues**

The `better-sqlite` package requires native compilation, which depends on certain system tools.
Prebuilt assets are available and used by default, but a custom compilation may be started depending on the Node.js
or Electron version used.
This compilation process is handled by `node-gyp` and may fail if required dependencies are missing or misconfigured.

Refer to the [PowerSync Node package README](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@powersync/node) for more details.
