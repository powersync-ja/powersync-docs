The next step after configuring your database and connecting it to your PowerSync instance, is to include the appropriate PowerSync Client SDK package in your app project. On a high level, this involves the following steps:

1. Install the SDK (see below)
2. [Define your Schema](/installation/client-side-setup/define-your-schema)
3. [Instantiate Local PowerSync Database](/installation/client-side-setup/instantiate-powersync-database)
4. [Integrate with your Backend](/installation/client-side-setup/integrating-with-your-backend) \[Optional\]
   1. Download data from your database
   2. Write mutations to your backend

PowerSync currently supports apps built in [Flutter](/client-sdk-references/flutter), [React Native & Expo](/client-sdk-references/react-native-and-expo), [JavaScript Web](/client-sdk-references/javascript-web), [Kotlin Multiplatform](/client-sdk-references/kotlin-multiplatform) (beta), and [Swift](/client-sdk-references/swift) (alpha).

Please see the steps based on your app framework:

<Accordion title="Flutter" icon="flutter">

 Add the [PowerSync pub.dev package](https://pub.dev/packages/powersync) to your project:

 ```bash
 flutter pub add powersync
 ```

 See the full SDK reference for further details and getting started instructions:

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="React Native & Expo" icon="react">
<Note>
 **PowerSync is not compatible with Expo Go.**
 PowerSync uses a native plugin and is therefore only compatible with Expo Dev Builds.
 </Note>

 Add the [PowerSync React Native NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@powersync/react-native) to your project:

 Run the below command in your project folder:
 <Tabs>
 <Tab title="npm">
 ```bash
 npm npx expo install @powersync/react-native
 ```
 </Tab>
 <Tab title="yarn">
 ```bash
 yarn expo install @powersync/react-native
 ```
 </Tab>
 <Tab title="pnpm">
 ```
 pnpm dlx expo install @powersync/react-native
 ```
 </Tab>
 </Tabs>


 <Info>
 **Some peer dependencies and polyfills are required.**

 **Note**: As of @powersync/react-native@1.9.0, polyfills are bundled in the SDK and are no longer required ([Async Iterator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@powersync/react-native#babel-plugins-watched-queries) support being the only exception).

 By default this SDK connects to a PowerSync instance via WebSocket (from @powersync/react-native@1.11.0) or HTTP Streaming (before @powersync/react-native@1.11.0). Different polyfill configurations are required for each method.

 * See the [Readme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@powersync/react-native#installation) for the necessary peer dependencies and polyfills.
 * See the [Developer Notes](/client-sdk-references/react-native-and-expo#developer-notes) section in the SDK reference for details about connecting with either method.
   * Also see this section for additional development requirements on Android and iOS.

<Accordion title="JavaScript/Web" icon="js">
  Add the [PowerSync JavaScript Web NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@powersync/web) to your project:

  <Tabs>
  <Tab title="npm">
  ```bash
  npm install @powersync/web
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="yarn">
  ```bash
  yarn install @powersync/web
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="pnpm">
  ```bash
  pnpm install @powersync/web
  ```
  </Tab>
  </Tabs>

  <Info>
  **Some peer dependencies are required.**

  **Note**: As of @powersync/web@1.4.0, polyfills are bundled in the SDK and are no longer required.

  See the [Readme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@powersync/web#installation) for the necessary peer dependencies that need to be installed.

  By default this SDK connects to a PowerSync instance via WebSocket (from @powersync/web@1.6.0) or HTTP stream (before @powersync/web@1.6.0).

  * See the [Developer Notes](/client-sdk-references/javascript-web#developer-notes) section in the SDK reference for details about connecting with either method.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Kotlin Multiplatform" icon="flag">

Add the [PowerSync SDK](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.powersync/core) to your project by adding the following to your `build.gradle.kts` file:

```gradle
kotlin {
    //...
    sourceSets {
        commonMain.dependencies {
            api("com.powersync:core:$powersyncVersion")
            // If you want to use the Supabase Connector, also add the following:
            implementation("com.powersync:connectors:$powersyncVersion")
        }
        //...
    }
}
```

#### Cocoapods

We recommend using Cocoapods (as opposed to SMP) for iOS targets. Add the following to the `cocoapods` config in your `build.gradle.kts`

```gradle
cocoapods {
    //...
    pod("powersync-sqlite-core") {
        linkOnly = true
    }

    framework {
        isStatic = true
        export("com.powersync:core")
    }
    //...
}
```

Note: The `linkOnly` attribute is set to `true` and framework is set to `isStatic = true` to ensure that the `powersync-sqlite-core` binaries are only statically linked.

<Accordion title="Swift" icon="swift">
1. Using `Package.swift:`

```swift
let package = Package(
    ...
    dependencies: [
        ...
        .package(
            url: "https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-kotlin",
            exact: "1.0.0-BETA5.0"
        ),
        .package(
            url: "https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-sqlite-core-swift",
        ),
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "YourTargetName",
            dependencies: [
                .product(
                    name: "PowerSync",
                    package: "powersync-kotlin"
                ),
                .product(
                    name: "PowerSyncSqliteCore",
                    package: "powersync-sqlite-core-swift"
                ),
            ]
        )
    ]
)
```

2.  Using Xcode:

    1. Follow [this](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-package-dependencies-to-your-app#Add-a-package-dependency) guide to add a package to your project.
    2.  When searching for the package use [https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-kotlin.git](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-kotlin.git) as the URL and include the exact version `1.0.0-BETA5.0` as shown below:

    <Frame>
        <img src="/images/swift.avif"></img>
    </Frame>

    3. Do the same for `power-sqlite-core-swift` using [https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-sqlite-core-swift.git](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-kotlin.git) and choose a range between `0.3.1` and `0.4.0` as shown below:

    <Frame>
        <img src="/images/image (1).png"></img>
    </Frame>

<Note>
    Use the exact version for `powersync-kotlin` as we are actively making changes to the Swift SDK which could result in breaking changes. The version history can be found [here](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.powersync/core/versions).
