description: Overview of monitoring and alerting functionality for PowerSync Cloud instances
---

You can monitor activity and alert on issues and usage for your PowerSync Cloud instance(s):

* **Monitor Usage**: View time-series and aggregated usage data with [Usage Metrics](#usage-metrics)

* **Monitor Service and Replication Activity**: Track your PowerSync Service and replication logs with [Instance Logs](#instance-logs)

* **Configure Alerts**: Set up alerts for connection or replication issues or usage activity \*

  * Includes [Issue Alerts](#issue-alerts) and/or [Usage Alerts](#usage-alerts)

* **Alert Notifications**: Set up [Email notifications](#email-notifications) or [Webhooks](#webhooks) to report events (like issue or usage alerts) to external systems \*

These features can assist with troubleshooting common issues (e.g. replication errors due to a logical replication slot problem), investigating usage spikes, or being notified when usage exceeds a specific threshold.

\* The availability of these features depends on your PowerSync Cloud plan. See the table below for a summary. More details are provided further below.

  <img src="/images/resources/view-usage-metrics.png" />
</Frame>

You have following options:

* **Filter options**: data by time range.

* **Granularity**: See data in a daily, hourly or minute granularity.

* **Aggregates**: View and copy aggregates for each usage metric.

<Info>
  This usage data is also available programmatically via APIs in an early access release. Chat to us on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/powersync) if you require details.
</Info>

## Instance Logs

You can review logs for your PowerSync instance(s) to troubleshoot replication or sync service issues. Logs capture activity from the PowerSync Service and Replicator processes.

* **Service/API logs**: Reflect sync processes from the PowerSync Service to clients.

* **Replicator logs**: Reflect replication activity from your source database to the PowerSync Service.

<Note>
  **Availability**

  The log retention period varies by plan:

  * **Free** plan: Logs from the last 24 hours

  * **Pro** plan: Logs from the last 7 days

  * **Team & Enterprise** plans: Logs from the last 30 days
</Note>

### View Instance Logs

Access instance logs through the [PowerSync Dashboard](https://dashboard.powersync.com/). Select your project and instance and go to the **Logs** view:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/resources/view-instance-logs.png" />
</Frame>

You can manage logs with the following options:

* **Filter Options**: Filter logs by level (`Note`, `Error`, `Warning`, `Debug`) and by date range.

* **Sorting**: Sort logs by newest or oldest first.

* **Metadata**: Display metadata like `user_id` and `user_agent` in the logs if available.

* **View Mode**: Tail logs in real-time or view them statically.

* **Stack Traces**: Option to show or hide stack traces for errors.

## Custom Metadata in Sync Logs

Custom metadata in sync logs allows clients to attach additional context to their PowerSync connection for improved observability and analytics. This metadata appears in the Service/API logs, making it easier to track, debug, and analyze sync behavior across your app. For example, you can tag connections with app version, feature flags, or business context.

### How to Use Custom Metadata

You can specify application metadata when calling `PowerSyncDatabase.connect()`. To update the metadata, reconnect with new metadata values.

### View Custom Metadata in Logs

Custom metadata appears in the **Service/API logs** section of the [PowerSync Dashboard](https://dashboard.powersync.com/). Navigate to your project and instance, then go to the **Logs** view. The metadata is included in **Sync Stream Started** and **Sync Stream Completed** log entries.

<Note>
  Make sure the **Metadata** checkbox is enabled in the logs view to see custom metadata in log entries.
</Note>

Note the following when using custom metadata:

* Keep metadata values concise. `app_metadata` is limited to 20 keys, with each string value capped at 100 characters.

* Avoid including sensitive information in metadata as it will appear in logs.

* Metadata is set per connection. Reconnect with new metadata when user context or app state changes (e.g., feature flags).

## Issue Alerts

Issue alerts capture potential problems with your instance, such as connection or replication issues.

<Note>
  **Availability**

  * Issue alerts are available on all Cloud plans.
</Note>

### Configure Issue Alerts

Issue alerts are set up per instance. To set up a new alert, navigate to the **Alerts** section in the [PowerSync Dashboard](https://dashboard.powersync.com/) and click **Create Issue Alert**.

When creating or editing an issue alert, you can configure:

* **Alert Name**: Give your alert a descriptive name to help identify it

* **Issue Type**: Select the type of issue to monitor from the dropdown:
  * **Database Connection Issue**: Trigger when there is a connection problem
  * **Replication Issue**: Trigger when there is an issue with the replication process

* **Severity Levels**: Choose which severity levels should trigger this alert:
  * **Warning**: For non-critical issues
  * **Fatal**: For critical issues that require immediate attention



<Warning>
  **Important: Set Up Notification Rules**

  Creating an issue alert only defines *what* to monitor. To actually receive notifications when alerts trigger, you must also set up [Email Rules](#email-notifications) or [Webhooks](#webhooks) and configure them to notify for "Issue alert state change" events. See the [Alert Notifications](#alert-notifications) section below.
</Warning>

## Usage Alerts

Usage alerts trigger when specific usage metrics exceed a defined threshold. This helps with troubleshooting usage spikes, or unexpected usage activity.

<Note>
  **Availability**

  Usage alerts are available on **Team** and **Enterprise** plans.
</Note>

### Configure Usage Alerts

Usage alerts are set up per instance. Navigate to the **Alerts** section in the [PowerSync Dashboard](https://dashboard.powersync.com/) and click **Create Usage Alert**.


When creating or editing a usage alert, you can configure:

* **Alert Name**: Give your alert a descriptive name to help identify it

* **Metric**: Select from the following usage metrics to monitor:
  * Data Synced
  * Data Replicated
  * Operations Synced
  * Operations Replicated
  * Peak Concurrent Connections
  * Storage Size

  <Note>
    These metrics correspond to the data shown in the [Usage Metrics](#view-usage-metrics) workspace and align with the PowerSync Service parameters outlined in our [pricing](https://www.powersync.com/pricing).
  </Note>

* **Window**: The number of minutes to look back when evaluating usage. All usage data points within this time window are included when determining if the configured threshold has been crossed

* **Aggregation**: Choose how to aggregate all data points within the window before comparing to the threshold:
  * **Avg**: Calculate the average of all values
  * **Max**: Use the highest value
  * **Min**: Use the lowest value

* **Condition**: Set whether the alert triggers when usage goes **Above** or **Below** the specified threshold

* **Threshold Value**: The numeric limit for the selected metric (in bytes for size-based metrics; count for all other metrics)


<Warning>
  **Important: Set Up Notification Rules**

  Creating a usage alert only defines *what* to monitor. To actually receive notifications when alerts trigger, you must also set up [Email Rules](#email-notifications) or [Webhooks](#webhooks) and configure them to notify for "Usage alert state change" events. See the [Alert Notifications](#alert-notifications) section below.
</Warning>

## Alert Notifications

Set up notification rules to be informed of issue or usage alerts, as well as deploy state changes. PowerSync provides multiple notification methods that trigger both when an alert becomes active and when it returns to normal (indicating the monitored conditions are back within acceptable thresholds).

* **Email Rules**: Send alerts directly to your email address
* **Webhooks**: Notify external systems and services

<Note>
  **Availability**

  * **Email Rules**: Available on all plans (**Free**, **Pro**, **Team** and **Enterprise**)

  * **Webhooks**: Available on **Pro**, **Team** and **Enterprise** plans
</Note>

### Email Rules

Email rules allow you to receive alerts directly to your email address when specific events occur in PowerSync.

#### Set Up Email Rules

Navigate to the **Alerts** section in the [PowerSync Dashboard](https://dashboard.powersync.com/) and scroll down to the **Notification Rules** section. Click **Create Email Rule** to set up email notifications.

<Warning>
  Accounts on the Free plan are restricted to a single email rule; customers on paid plans can create an unlimited number of email rules.
</Warning>

When creating or editing an email rule, you can configure:

* **Recipient Email**: Specify the email address that will receive the notifications (required)

* **Event Triggers**: Select one or more of the following events to trigger the email notification:
  * **Usage alert state change**: Fired when a usage alert changes between 'monitoring' and 'alerting' (a threshold has been crossed)
  * **Issue alert state change**: Fired when an issue alert changes between 'monitoring' and 'alerting' (the instance has active issues)
  * **Deploy state change**: Fired when an instance deploy starts, completes or fails. This includes deprovisioning an instance

* **Enabled**: Toggle to control whether the email rule is active


### Webhooks

Webhooks enable you to notify external systems when specific events occur in PowerSync.

#### Set Up Webhooks

Navigate to the **Alerts** section in the [PowerSync Dashboard](https://dashboard.powersync.com/) and scroll down to the **Notification Rules** section. Click **Create Webhook Rule** to set up webhook notifications.

When creating or editing a webhook rule, you can configure:

* **Webhook Endpoint (URL)**: Define the endpoint that will receive the webhook request (starting with `https://`) (required)

* **Event Triggers**: Select one or more of the following events to trigger the webhook:
  * **Usage alert state change**: Fired when a usage alert changes between 'monitoring' and 'alerting' (a threshold has been crossed)
  * **Issue alert state change**: Fired when an issue alert changes between 'monitoring' and 'alerting' (the instance has active issues)
  * **Deploy state change**: Fired when an instance deploy starts, completes or fails. This includes deprovisioning an instance

* **Enabled**: Toggle to control whether the webhook rule is active

* **Retries**: Configure the number of retry attempts for failed webhook deliveries


<Check>
  After creating a webhook, a secret is automatically generated and copied to your clipboard. Store this secret since you'll need it to verify the webhook request signature.
</Check>

### Webhook Signature Verification

Every webhook request contains an `x-journey-signature` header, which is a base64-encoded HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code). To verify the request, you need to compute the HMAC using the shared secret that was generated when you created the webhook, and compare it to the value in the `x-journey-signature` header.

**JavaScript Example:**

```javascript
import { createHmac } from 'crypto';

// Extract the signature from the request headers
const signature = request.header('x-journey-signature');

// Create an HMAC using your webhook secret and the request body
let verify = createHmac('sha256', '<webhook_secret_here>') // The secret provided during webhook setup
    .update(Buffer.from(request.body, 'utf-8')) 
    .digest('base64');

// Compare the computed HMAC with the signature from the request
if (signature === verify) {
    console.log("success");
} else {
    console.log("verification failed");
}
```
