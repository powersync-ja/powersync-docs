title: "Organize Data Into Buckets"
---

To sync different sets of data to each user, data is organized into buckets.

Each [bucket definition](/sync/rules/overview#bucket-definition) defines a set of tables/collections and rows/documents to sync.

The bucket definition contains two sets of queries:

1. [Parameter Queries](/sync/rules/parameter-queries): Select bucket parameters

2. [Data Queries](/sync/rules/data-queries): Select data in the bucket using the bucket parameters

When designing your buckets, it is recommended, but not required, to group all data in a bucket where the same parameters apply.

An example:

```yaml
bucket_definitions:
  user_lists:
    # select parameters for the bucket - in this case we are just selecting the user_id
    parameters: SELECT request.user_id() as user_id # (request.user_id() comes from the JWT token)  
    data:
      # select data rows/documents using the parameters above
      - SELECT * FROM lists WHERE owner_id = bucket.user_id
```

<Note>
  You can choose any name for a bucket. The above Sync Rules contains only one bucket definition, with a bucket name of `user_lists`.
</Note>

<Note>
  **Note**: Table names within Sync Rules must match the names defined in your [client-side schema](/intro/setup-guide#define-your-client-side-schema).
</Note>


## Limit on Number of Buckets Per Client

There is a maximum cap on the number of buckets that each user/client can sync — [the default limit](/resources/performance-and-limits) is 1,000.

What this practically means is that the total number of <Tooltip tip="Global Buckets can also add to the number of buckets, but this usually has neglible impact">results returned from all the **Parameter Queries**</Tooltip> across all your bucket definitions _for each specific user/client_ cannot exceed that limit. 

Note that this limit only applies to each individual user/client. You can have many more buckets in total in your project, as long as each user syncs no more total buckets than the limit.

<Note>This limit can be increased upon request for [Team and Enterprise]((https://www.powersync.com/pricing)) customers, however: as the number of buckets exceeds 1,000, performance degrades. See [Performance and Limits](/resources/performance-and-limits)</Note>
