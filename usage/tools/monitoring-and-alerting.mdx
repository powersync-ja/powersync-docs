You can set up alerts that trigger under certain conditions:

* **Connection Issues**: Trigger when there is a connection problem

* **Replication/Sync Issues**: Trigger when there is an issue with a replication or sync process

#### Severity Level

You also have the option to set the severity level of the alerts. For example, you can configure alerts to trigger only for `warning` and/or `fatal` issues. Free and Pro plan customers can only configure `fatal` alerts.

### View Issue Alerts

Once you have created an alert, you can right-click on it to open the alert logs. The logs panel includes the option to filter alerts by date range.

This command and other configuration options are also available from the [command palette](/usage/tools/powersync-dashboard#the-command-palette) (SHIFT+SHIFT):

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/resources/view-issue-alert-logs-cmd.png" />
</Frame>

### **Alert Notifications**

See [Webhooks](#webhooks) below to notify external systems when an alert is triggered.

## Metric Alerts

Metric alerts trigger when specific usage metrics exceed a defined threshold. This helps with troubleshooting usage spikes, or unexpected usage activity.

<Note>
  **Availability**

  Metrics alerts are available on **Team** and **Enterprise** plans.
</Note>

### Configure Metric Alerts

Metric alerts are set up per instance. Navigate to your **PowerSync Project** tree, and right-click on the **Metric Alerts** option under your selected instance to create a new alert.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/instance-alerts-dashboard.png" width="50%" />
</Frame>

You can set alerts for the following usage metrics:

* **Data Synced**

* **Data Replicated**

* **Operations Synced**

* **Operations Replicated**

* **Peak Concurrent Connections**

* **Storage Size**

Thresholds can be set to trigger alerts when usage exceeds or falls below a specified value.

### View Metric Alert Logs

Once you have created an alert, you can right-click on it to open the alert logs. The logs panel includes the option to filter alerts by date range.

This command and other configuration options are also available from the [command palette](/usage/tools/powersync-dashboard#the-command-palette) (SHIFT+SHIFT):

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/resources/view-metric-alert-logs-cmd.png" />
</Frame>

### **Alert Notifications**

See [Webhooks](#webhooks) below to notify external systems when an alert is triggered.

## Webhooks

Webhooks enable you to notify external systems when specific events occur in PowerSync, such as issue or metric alerts.

<Note>
  **Availability**

  * Webhooks are currently available on **Pro**, **Team** and **Enterprise** plans.

  * Email notifications will be available in a future release (these will also be available to **Free** plan users).
</Note>

### Set Up Webhooks

Navigate to the **Webhooks** section in your **PowerSync Project** tree, and right-click on it to create a new webhook for your project.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/instance-alerts-dashboard.png" width="50%" />
</Frame>

#### Configuration

* **Specify Webhook Endpoint**: Define the endpoint that will receive the webhook request (starting with `https://`).

* **Event Triggers**: Select one or more of the following events to trigger the webhook:

  * Issue alert state change

  * Metric alert state change (Team & Enterprise plan only)

  * Deploy state change (Team & Enterprise plan only)

You can control how webhooks operate:

* Enable, disable, or pause a webhook

  * If paused, invocations can still be generated and queued, but they won't be processed

  * If disabled, invocations won't be generated

* Choose sequential or concurrent execution

  * If concurrent, you can set the maximum number of concurrent invocations

* Configure retry attempts for failed webhook deliveries

#### Webhook secret

After creating a webhook, a secret is automatically generated and copied to your clipboard. Store this secret since you'll need it to verify the webhook request signature. See [Webhook Signature Verification](#webhook-signature-verification)

### Test Webhooks

A test webhook can be sent to your specified endpoint to verify your setup. Right-click on a webhook in the **PowerSync project** tree and select the **Test Webhook** option:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/resources/test-webhook-cmd.png" />
</Frame>

### Webhook Signature Verification

Every webhook request contains an `x-journey-signature` header, which is a base64-encoded HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code). To verify the request, you need to compute the HMAC using the shared secret that was generated when you created the webhook, and compare it to the value in the `x-journey-signature` header.

**JavaScript Example**

```javascript
import { createHmac } from 'crypto';

// Extract the signature from the request headers
const signature = request.header('x-journey-signature');

// Create an HMAC using your webhook secret and the request body
let verify = createHmac('sha256', '<webhook_secret_here>') // The secret provided during webhook setup
    .update(Buffer.from(request.body, 'utf-8')) 
    .digest('base64');

// Compare the computed HMAC with the signature from the request
if (signature === verify) {
    console.log("success");
} else {
    console.log("verification failed");
}
```

#### Regenerate secret

You can regenerate the secret used to validate the webhook signature. Right-click on a webhook in the PowerSync project tree and select the **Regenerate secret** option.

### View Webhook Invocation Logs

You can review webhook invocation logs in the Dashboard and filter them by date. Right-click on a webhook in the **PowerSync project** tree and select the **View webhook invocation logs** option.
