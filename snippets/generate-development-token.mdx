    1. In the [PowerSync Dashboard](https://dashboard.powersync.com/), select your project and instance
    2. Go to the **Client Auth** view
    3. Check the "Enable development tokens" setting and save your changes
    4. Click the **Connect** button in the top bar
    5. Enter a user ID:
       - If you're using **global Sync Rules**, you can enter any value (e.g., `test-user`) since all data syncs to all users
       - If you're using **user-specific Sync Rules**, enter a user ID that matches a user in your database (this will be used as `request.user_id()` in your Sync Rules)
    6. Click **Generate Token** and copy the token

      Development tokens expire after 12 hours.

  <Tab title="Self-Hosted">
    For self-hosted setups, you can generate development tokens using the [powersync-service test-client](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-service/tree/main/test-client):

    #### Step 1: Generate a shared secret

    To generate a shared secret, you can use this [Online JWS key generator](https://8gwifi.org/jwsgen.jsp):

    <Note>
      You don't need to edit the default payload in the [Online JWS key generator](https://8gwifi.org/jwsgen.jsp).
      You simply need to obtain the generated shared secret value.
    </Note>

    1. Click **Generate JWS Keys**
    2. Copy the shared secret value

    <Warning>
      Using an online key generator for secrets in a production environment is not recommended.
    </Warning>

    #### Step 2: Update `powersync.yaml`

    Update the `k` value in the `jwks` `keys` in your `powersync.yaml` config file with the shared secret value copied in the previous step:

    ```yaml powersync.yaml
    # Client (application end user) authentication settings
    client_auth:
        # JWKS URIs can be specified here
        jwks_uri: !env PS_JWKS_URL
        jwks:
            keys:
                - kty: 'oct'
                  k: 'YOUR_GENERATED_SHARED_SECRET'
                  alg: 'HS256'
    ```

    #### Step 3: Generate a development token

    1. If you have not done so already, clone the [powersync-service repo](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-service/tree/main)
    2. Install the dependencies
       - In the project root, run the following commands:
         ```bash
         pnpm install
         pnpm build:packages
         ```
       - In the `test-client` directory, run the following commands:
         ```bash
         pnpm build
         ```
    3. Generate a new token by running the following command in the `test-client` directory with your updated `powersync.yaml` config file:
       ```bash
       node dist/bin.js generate-token --config path/to/powersync.yaml --sub test-user
       ```
       
       Replace `test-user` with the user ID you want to authenticate:
       - If you're using **global Sync Rules**, you can use any value (e.g., `test-user`) since all data syncs to all users
       - If you're using **user-specific Sync Rules**, use a user ID that matches a user in your database (this will be used as `request.user_id()` in your Sync Rules)

    <Note>
      Development tokens expire after 12 hours.
