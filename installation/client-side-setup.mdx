The next step after configuring your database and connecting it to your PowerSync instance, is to include the appropriate PowerSync Client SDK package in your app project. On a high level, this involves the following steps:

1. Install the SDK (see below)

2. [Define your Schema](/installation/client-side-setup/define-your-schema)

3. [Instantiate Local PowerSync Database](/installation/client-side-setup/instantiate-powersync-database)

4. [Integrate with your Backend](/installation/client-side-setup/integrating-with-your-backend) \[Optional]

   1. Download data from your database

   2. Write mutations to your backend

PowerSync currently supports apps built in [Flutter](/client-sdk-references/flutter), [React Native & Expo](/client-sdk-references/react-native-and-expo), [JavaScript Web](/client-sdk-references/javascript-web), [Node.js](/client-sdk-references/node) (alpha), [Kotlin Multiplatform](/client-sdk-references/kotlin-multiplatform) (beta), [Swift](/client-sdk-references/swift), and [.NET](/client-sdk-references/dotnet) (alpha).
