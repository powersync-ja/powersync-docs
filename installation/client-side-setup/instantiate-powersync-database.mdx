PowerSync streams changes from your backend database into the client-side SQLite database, based on your [Sync Rules](/usage/sync-rules).

In your client-side app, you can read from and write to the local SQLite database, whether the user is online or offline. Any writes that are made to the SQLite database are placed into an upload queue by the PowerSync Client SDK and automatically uploaded to your app backend (where you apply those changes to the backend database) when the user is connected. This is explained in the next section, [Integrate with your Backend](/installation/client-side-setup/integrating-with-your-backend).

## Example implementation

For an example implementation of instantiating the client-side database, see the _Getting Started_ section of the client SDK reference for your platform:
