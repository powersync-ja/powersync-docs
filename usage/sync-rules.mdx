# Understanding PowerSync Sync Rules

PowerSync Sync Rules give developers precise control over data synchronization between devices. They enable dynamic partial replication, allowing you to specify exactly which data should be synced to which devices.

## Core Concepts

<Note>
  New to Sync Rules? We recommend starting with our [Sync Rules from First Principles](https://www.powersync.com/blog/sync-rules-from-first-principles-partial-replication-to-sqlite) blog post. It provides a high-level overview of what Sync Rules are, their purpose, and implementation strategies.
</Note>

## Sync Rules Configuration

### SQL-Like Query Syntax

Each [PowerSync Service](/architecture/powersync-service) instance uses a YAML configuration file to define Sync Rules. These rules are written using SQL-like queries that work across different backend databases:

- PostgreSQL
- MongoDB 
- MySQL

## Data Replication Process

### Step 1: Sync Bucket Creation

PowerSync replicates and transforms data from your backend database according to your defined Sync Rules. This data is organized into discrete sync buckets on the PowerSync Service.

<Info>
  Sync buckets maintain both current state data and a complete history of changes through incremental updates.

### Step 2: Client Database Synchronization

The PowerSync Client SDK manages local SQLite databases on each device. These databases are automatically hydrated with data from the appropriate sync buckets through an asynchronous process.
