# PowerSync for AI Coding Tools

We've created resources to help you work with PowerSync using AI-powered IDE tools like Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Claude Desktop, or Windsurf. These tools can help you implement PowerSync features faster and more efficiently.

## AI-Accessible Documentation

PowerSync's documentation is optimized for AI tools in several ways:

### Markdown Version of Documentation Pages

For any page in our documentation, you can append `.md` to the URL to get the Markdown version, which is more easily readable by AI tools, for example:

```
https://docs.powersync.com/client-sdk-references/javascript-web.md
```

<Tip>
Press **CTRL/CMD+C** to easily copy the markdown content of the current page to share with your AI assistant.
</Tip>

### Full Documentation Text

We provide text versions of our documentation that AI tools can easily ingest:

- **Full Documentation**: [https://docs.powersync.com/llms-full.txt](https://docs.powersync.com/llms-full.txt)
  - Our entire documentation site in a single text file
  - Perfect for giving your AI assistant complete context about PowerSync

- **Page Outline**: [https://docs.powersync.com/llms.txt](https://docs.powersync.com/llms.txt)
  - All documentation pages in a single text file
  - This helps AI assistants index our documentation

## AI Prompts for PowerSync Tasks

> **Coming Soon**

We're developing a collection of prompts for common PowerSync implementation tasks. These prompts will help you scaffold PowerSync functionality in your applications faster when working with AI coding assistants.

Let us know on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/powersync) what prompts you'd like to see!


## Best Practices for AI-Assisted PowerSync Development

When working with AI coding assistants consider these tips for better results:

1. **Provide Context**: Tell the AI tool which PowerSync SDK you're using and your app's framework
2. **Share Documentation**: Include links to specific PowerSync documentation pages relevant to your task
3. **Clarify Your Schema**: Describe your app's schema/data model and sync requirements clearly
4. **Specify Authentication**: Detail your authentication approach (Supabase, Firebase, Auth0, etc.)
5. **Define Sync Rules**: If applicable, share your sync rules to help the AI understand your data flow
