## Overview

PowerSync self-hosted deployments have minimal backup requirements. This page covers what you need to consider.

## Configuration Files

We recommend using Git to version control and backup your PowerSync configuration files:

- `powersync.yaml` - Service configuration
- [`sync-rules.yaml`](/usage/sync-rules)

PowerSync containers use no persistent storage - configuration is mounted from the host and all data is stored in external databases, so no container-level backups are required.

## Bucket Storage Database

The [sync bucket storage](/usage/sync-rules/organize-data-into-buckets) database (MongoDB or Postgres) may be backed up using standard database backup procedures. However, this is optional since bucket data can be fully recovered by re-replicating from the source database.

<Note>
Bucket storage contains derived data from your source database. If lost, PowerSync can rebuild it automatically through [replication](/architecture/powersync-service#replication).
</Note>

## Source Database

For guidance on what happens when you restore your source database, including multi-tenant recovery scenarios, see [Restoring Your Source Database](/usage/lifecycle-maintenance/restoring-source-database).
