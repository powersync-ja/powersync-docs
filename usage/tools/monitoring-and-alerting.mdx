title: Monitoring and Alerting
description: Overview of monitoring and alerting functionality for PowerSync instances
---

You can monitor activity and alert on issues and usage for your PowerSync instance(s):

* **Monitor Service and Replication Activity**: Track your PowerSync service and replication logs with [Instance Logs](#instance-logs)
* **Configure Alerts**: Set up alerts for connection issues or usage activity \*
  * Includes [Issue Alerts](#issue-alerts) and/or [Metric Alerts](#metric-alerts)
* **Webhooks**: Set up [Webhooks](#webhooks) to report events (like issue or metric alerts) to external systems \*

These features can assist with troubleshooting common issues (e.g. replication errors due to a logical replication slot problem), investigating usage spikes, or being notified when usage exceeds a specific threshold.

\* The availability of these features depends on your PowerSync subscription. See the table below for a summary. More details are provided further below.

* **Sorting**: Sort logs by newest or oldest first.
* **Service Logs Metadata**: Include metadata like `user_id` and `user_agent` in the logs if available.
* **View Mode**: Tail logs in real-time or view them statically.
* **Stack Traces**: Option to show or hide stack traces for errors.

## Issue Alerts

Issue alerts capture potential problems with your instance, such as connection or sync issues.

<info>
**Availability**

* Coming soon: **Free** and **Pro** plan customers will be able to opt in to receive fatal issue alerts.
* **Team** and **Enterprise** customers can customize the issue type and severity level for which an alert should trigger.
</info>

### Configure Issue Alerts

Issue alerts are set up per instance. To set up a new alert, navigate to your **PowerSync Project tree**, right-click on the "Issue Alerts" option under the selected instance, and follow the prompts.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/instance-alerts-dashboard.png" width="50%" />
</Frame>

You can set up alerts that trigger under certain conditions:

* **Connection Issues**: Trigger when there is a connection problem
* **Replication/Sync Issues**: Trigger when there is an issue with a replication or sync process

#### Severity Level

You also have the option to set the severity level of the alerts. For example, you can configure alerts to trigger only for `warning` and/or `fatal` issues. Free and Pro plan customers can only configure `fatal` alerts.

### View Issue Alerts

Once you have created an alert, you can right-click on it to open the alert logs. The logs panel includes the option to filter alerts by date range.

  <img src="/images/Screenshot 2024-10-15 at 2.09.41 PM.png"/>
</Frame>

### **Alert Notifications**

See [Webhooks](#webhooks) below to notify external systems when an alert is triggered.

## Webhooks

Webhooks enable you to notify external systems when specific events occur in PowerSync, such as issue or metric alerts.

<info>
**Availability**

* Webhooks are currently available on **Team** and **Enterprise** plans.
* Coming soon: **Pro** plan customers will be able to set up webhooks for Issue alerts.
* Email notifications will be available in a future release (also for **Free** plan users).
</info>

### Set Up Webhooks

Navigate to the **Webhooks** section in your **PowerSync Project** tree, and right-click on it to create a new webhook for your project.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/instance-alerts-dashboard.png" width="50%" />
</Frame>

#### Configuration

* **Specify Webhook Endpoint**: Define the endpoint that will receive the webhook request (starting with `https://`).
* **Event Triggers**: Select one or more of the following events to trigger the webhook:
  * Issue alert state change
  * Metric alert state change (Team & Enterprise customer only)
  * Deploy state change (Team & Enterprise customer only)

You can control how webhooks operate:

* Enable, disable, or pause a webhook
  * If paused, invocations can still be generated and queued, but they won't be processed
  * If disabled, invocations won't be generated
* Choose sequential or concurrent execution
  * If concurrent, you can set the maximum number of concurrent invocations
* Configure retry attempts for failed webhook deliveries

#### Webhook secret

After creating a webhook, a secret is automatically generated and copied to your clipboard. Store this secret since you'll need it to verify the webhook request signature. See [Webhook Signature Verification](#webhook-signature-verification)

### Test Webhooks

A test webhook can be sent to your specified endpoint to verify your setup. Right-click on a webhook in the **PowerSync project** tree and select the **Test Webhook** option:

  <img src="/images/Screenshot 2024-10-15 at 2.29.19 PM.png"/>
</Frame>

### Webhook Signature Verification

Every webhook request contains an `x-journey-signature` header, which is a base64-encoded HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code). To verify the request, you need to compute the HMAC using the shared secret that was generated when you created the webhook, and compare it to the value in the `x-journey-signature` header.

**JavaScript Example**

```javascript
import { createHmac } from 'crypto';

// Extract the signature from the request headers
const signature = request.headers['x-journey-signature'];

// Create an HMAC using your webhook secret and the request body
let verify = createHmac('sha256', '<webhook_secret_here>') // The secret provided during webhook setup
    .update(Buffer.from(request.rawBody, 'utf-8')) 
    .digest('base64');

// Compare the computed HMAC with the signature from the request
if (signature === verify) {
    console.log("success");
} else {
    console.log("verification failed");
}
```

#### Regenerate secret

You can regenerate the secret used to validate the webhook signature. Right-click on a webhook in the PowerSync project tree and select the **Regenerate secret** option.

### View Webhook Invocation Logs

You can review webhook invocation logs in the Dashboard and filter them by date. Right-click on a webhook in the **PowerSync project** tree and select the **View webhook invocation logs** option.
